Instead Mercier sided with the protesters, declaring the people's complete independence from crown authority.",
  "110720": "All are hostages of capitalism so long as they need to pay a ransom to fulfil their basic needs. Dr. Mercier wants you to increase the production of bread and stock up on it. Surely he has some tricks to make the stale loaves easier on the jaw.",

Working hard to serve their own needs and those of their community, instead of feeding a capitalist leech.",

We produce so much and gobble up so little, we can barely close our storeroom doors! Take as much as you need, think of it as a sample of what our system can achieve.",
  "110726": "The word about Hugo Mercier's anarchist utopia has travelled far and wide and reached the ears of a receptive crowd. People from all corners of the world are travelling to join his commune and Hugo has asked you to grant them a safe passage.",

Dr. Harvey Sprucer, one of the heads of Social Darwinism in the Old World, begs to differ, and has asked to be taken to Mercier's island to judge with eyes unclouded. Unafraid of confronting challenging ideas, Hugo has accepted and would like you to provide transport for the gentleman.",
  "110731": "Capitalists owners love to blame their wretched policies on natural order and the survival of the fittest, but our community exemplifies that humans are nothing but kind to each other when they are not being corrupted. A Social-Darwinist has expressed his desire to see for himself what our ideas translate into when put into practice. Of course, we agreed. He only needs a safe transport here.",
  "110732": "That was the healthiest, most edifying debate I have had in a while! Dr. Sprucer has been convinced of the pure-hearted nature of men and women after meeting the most enlightened members of our community. Escort him safely back, he will make a good case for our true spirit to his heartless colleagues.",

  "110734": "I profoundly admire Mr. La Fortune. A true breaker of chains, founder of a nation free of oppressors! If anything, he should let go of that leadership he grasps so strongly, empower his people, build up trust. He'd love a read of Krapotkin's \"Reciprocal Support\". Would you bring it to him as a token of my esteem?",
  "110735": "Dr. Mercier is radically opposed to all institutions. Police, as a weapon of the State to threaten individuals into an unnatural order, is maybe the one he most detests. He has challenged you to get rid of all your police stations.",
  "110736": "People's voices must not be repressed under institutional coercion! Snap off the braces and society will naturally straighten itself. Unless you fear the people's free will.",
  "110737": "No trial is a fair trial under the corrupted laws of capitalism. Hugo has asked you to free some political prisoners from Eli Bleakworth's gaol, so they can be held accountable before his unbiased, enlightened people.",
  "110738": "How can the people be blamed for rebelling against plutocrats? The lives taken by capitalism far exceed the ones those men were driven to take. Of course the corrupt justice system pronounced them guilty... Their fate must be decided by the people!",
  "110913": "The State is far more than just an unnecessary institution, it is the most harmful fabrication of the privileged! We need to bring the government down by any means necessary, burn their tools of intrusion!",
  "110914": "The State is Anarchy's ultimate enemy. As the main representative of the government around, Sir Archibald —or rather, his fleet— has become Dr. Mercier's main target for sabotage.",
  "110917": "A couple of decrepit judges in powdered wigs should not hold power over the fate of men. Come, see how the whole community comes together to decide on a fitting punishment for this man's crimes, witness what true justice looks like. Then document the event and showcase it to your people!",
  "110918": "Dr. Mercier is proud of the justice system they have established, and has asked you to attend, listen to, photograph and publish an article about the trial they are holding.",
  "110919": "Everything he stole belongs to the community! Dr. Hugo always warns about the ill-intentions of those who take things, that naturally belong to humanity, for their own selfish sake, he must not go unpunished!",
  "110920": "Those goods belong to us all in the first place, so he is no thief. He simply needs to learn to reassess the extent of his needs. Persuasion goes a longer way than punishment, Dr. Hugo always insists on that!",
  "110921": "RESTORATIVE JUSTICE",

  "110923": "A merchant who'll pay a price to match the effort needed to produce a good, rather than the deflated value given it by the so-called \"free\" market? I'd never fall for such a blatant attempt to infiltrate us. Follow her ship, bring me proof of her true intentions.",
  "110924": "Dr. Mercier highly doubts that someone as complicit to capitalism as a merchant would willingly pay the prices the labour theory of value dictates. He's convinced she's up to no good and has asked you to follow the merchant and inform him about her true colours.",
  "110925": "Utopian, naïve, childish, preposterous... Oh, how those stuck-ups at the Medical School enjoyed mocking my ideals. But I have always been the better man. Yes, I will open up my doors to them, let them contemplate what they once laughed at. Bring them these formal invitations.",
  "110926": "Dr. Mercier has not forgotten how his colleagues at the Medical School laughed at his anarchist ideas. But now that his dreams have become a reality, he has decided to extend a friendly invitation to them. Sounds like he can't wait to see the look on their faces...",
  "110927": "Sir Archibald Blake, that phony old man... I bet the peacocks on his back garden are better fed than most of his Queen's subjects. I despise those flamboyant creatures and everything they stand for... Yes, of course...! If you want to prove something, kidnap one of his precious peacocks!",

  "18418": "Having been found, Bente's expedition captain reaches out to you. Everyone aboard seems to be too stunned to remember what happened to them, and how they ended up being wrecked. Perhaps there are clues nearby...",
  "18419": "Finally realising the sequence of events, the captain reluctantly agrees to lead you to the flotsam, so you can recover what he believes to be a cursed artefact.",
  "18420": "Recovering the artefact does indeed seem to have cursed your ship, and you never found those missing crewmen... But Bente won't believe any of that, so you'd better bring her the mummy.",
  "18421": "The mummy you gave Bente to put in her museum is seemingly responsible for an epidemic of disease in her city. Bente is understandably keen to obtain the emergency medical supplies Isabel Sarmento has on offer.",
  "3144": "My assorted pets have such a healthy appetite, they go berserk for boiled potatoes! I really can't keep up with them! Please, bring me as many as you can!",
  "3156": "Pigs are one of my favourite animals - so intelligent and cuddlesome! I fear most people just don't understand them. Oh, yes! How about we organise a parade to spread some goodwill for the little piggies!",
  "3582": "I cannot risk building a steelworks when this island is home to the Ebony Jewelwing - the soot would smudge their delicate little wings! Perhaps I could buy my beams from you instead?",
  "3676": "I love visiting the orphans, but it always breaks my heart... They're only children, they should be playing and scoffing sweets! I'd like to give them a treat - could I sneak some from your pantry?",
  "3675": "You should have seen their innocent, hungry eyes... I just had to give them all the bread we had! It didn't even occur to me that my people need it too...",
  "3856": "I need some new sails before I can set out! What happened to the old ones? Well... all those poor people were out in the cold, so I had to think quickly!",
  "3857": "I normally prefer to live on nuts and fruits, but the captain is right - we can't venture out on a polar expedition without plenty of fatty food. Would you happen to have any canned food we could use?",
  "3858": "I cannot believe I've been wearing leather boots when they could have been made of caoutchouc all along! If you were able to bring me some, you might help prevent the needless loss of animal lives...",
  "3163": "I cannot simply look away from the red trail whalers leave in their wake. Quickly! Sink their ship while I entertain the crew at my harbour!",
  "3160": "My expedition crashed during a storm! The crew saved their own lives, but they couldn't take the hyacinth macaws with them! Please, please - save them before it's too late!",
  "3181": "What a terrible tragedy! A visitor's ship has capsized! We cannot stand idle - we must help the passengers!",
  "3842": "Poor sailors' superstitions drove them to throw my precious relics overboard. Please retrieve the lost cargo before it's lost forever! I can take any silly curse they bear.",
  "4081": "Our oceans are becoming more and more cluttered by the day! I fear for the marine life... Clean up with me, and people will surely start to follow our example!",
  "3894": "I know my advisors only want the best for me, but sometimes they can be so... bothersome. They insist I shouldn't go alone on my expeditions. Please, would you sail with me a little bit, just to set their minds at ease?",
  "4097": "Cousin Alva had to cut her visit short - apparently the poor thing is allergic to my pets! You should have seen her face when she opened the door to their welcome chorus! Could you see her home for me, perhaps?",
  "18306": "My museum is coming along rather nicely, but as with everything, it can always be improved! If you could spare the time, I'd like to hang some pictures of my artefacts around the gallery - but I'll need a photographer first...",
  "18338": "I know why you haven't built a zoo; you're worried it would be cruel. I felt the same, until I realised my zoo could protect endangered species from extinction! Not to mention educating people of all walks of life about the joy of the wilderness!",
  "18339": "Why don't you build a museum? I have so many fascinating artefacts I could give you if you did! It's terrible, really - the display cabinets are so stuffed, I'm forced to keep most of my collection in a dusty undercroft...",
  "18343": "I will not make a habit of interfering with nature, but I have heard the winter is likely to be particularly hard this year. As such, I'd prefer if the animals on my island were kept safe in the comfort of my zoo until the weather improves. Please say you're able to help?",
  "18345": "Madame Kahina has recently imported some exotic animals, and I've decided I shall be the one to take care of them. They'll need a great deal of love, since they're all so far from home. Sadly, my ships are all on expeditions at the moment, so I wondered if you might collect them for me?",
  "18352": "Here to collect Bente's animals? But you're three days early! They're still in their crates! If you want them now, you'll have to find them yourself.",
  "18359": "Everyone needs love in their lives, and animals give it freely! Please, take care of this dear little cat. Since he's grown, I find I don't have quite so much time for him anymore. He is rather big these days, but I'm sure he'll make you very happy!",
  "18360": "I'm back! I think that might just have been my best expedition yet. We would have been completely lost without the local guide, but instead we saw emerald forest weighed down with serpents; a funny sandy thingy where I sadly lost a few men; and in the end we found an enormous treasure! Here you go, you can have it.",
  "18362": "A lack of material wealth should never hold us back from doing great deeds! I want to donate a small amount to help keep you on your feet. Sometimes when we run a little short on funds, we worry about relying too much on others. All I intend with this gift is to negate that sort of awkwardness in the future.",
  "18381": "Princess Qing tells me that some heirlooms belonging to her forefathers remain locked away at High Clarence Hall, and the Emperor has written to the Queen several times to ask for them back. I know it's naughty, but if you could somehow get them to the Princess, the world would be a better place for it.",
  "18382": "Dear Mr. Smith always keeps an eye out for mistreated animals, and sends them to me by sea. Unfortunately, this time, they seem unusually late. Something must have happened... Do you also have George's compassion? Could you rescue them for me?",
  "18391": "My advisors always remind me how indecent it is for a young, wealthy lady like me to remain single. They've found a perfect suitor in Mr Bingle, apparently - a man I know nothing about. I suppose I should at least meet him. Perhaps Sir Archibald might introduce us?",
  "18392": "\"Mr . Bingle is a correct man who enjoys the hunt, and owns a textile business\". Is it awful to say he doesn't sound too much fun? Well, perhaps I shouldn't judge just yet. If I'm to meet him at Sir Archibald's garden party, I'll need some dresses from the Emporium Exotique.",
  "18393": "I'm afraid you arrived just as Mr. Bingle left. He said nice things about my dresses, but not the company I keep. I am not to meet with Alonso any more, he says. *sobs*. But as Sir Archibald says, it's probably for my own good. Anyway, I must go, or I shall be late for the garden party...",
  "18394": "I keep hearing about Mr. Bingle. It makes me excited to finally meet him! BRING HIM TO ME! Hehe. Ahh, poor Bente - all these people around her, telling her what to do. She's just like a bird in one of those cages, eh?",
  "18395": "It's funny. Mr. Bingle confessed to me that he has no interest in Bente - only her pigs. See for yourself, he's rolling out there in the mud right now. I'm sure she'd love to see a photograph?",
  "18396": "Our dear child is ready for marriage? And to Mr. Bingle of all people? Well, please do give her this letter: an invitation to our little garden party, at which said Mr. Bingle will also be present.",
  "18397": "Meet Graves? Fine! If he wants to meet, w-w-why not? If he thinks this will scare me away from Miss Jorgensen, he's very much mistaken.",
  "18398": "Oh, this photograph is horrid! Did you take it? I mean, I adore animals, but not like this! How can I forgive myself for almost breaking ties with Alonso? He's proven once again to be the only *very* close friend I have.",
  "18402": "Beryl seems to have done a wonderful job of teaching these street children good manners. I'm sure the Queen would be delighted to have them stay at the palace for a short time — it could help fulfil some of the promises to help the poor she's made as of late.",
  "18403": "Sir Archibald didn't grimace too heavily as he announced the Queen had agreed to let the street children stay over at High Clarence Hall. Can you make sure they have a lovely, safe trip? I promised Beryl I'd take good care of them, you see.",
  "18404": "I have written to Sir Archibald to apologise for the behaviour of the street children at the palace. Please, could you deliver my message? If Archie asks, tell him Beryl's agreed to pay any damages she can, though she did say that she isn't a woman of great family wealth. If the repairs are very expensive, it may be beyond her.",
  "18405": "Oh Bente, you poor dear soul! Those children weren't merely a menace, they were a highly-organised gang of thieves! There's not a bit of silver cutlery left in all of High Clarence Hall!",

  "18422": "The expedition to the ruins of the sun worshippers should have been back weeks ago! I do remember they were worried about a mysterious curse... I wonder if you might find them and help them?",
  "18423": "Ahoy! Our heartiest thanks for your help. The last we remember, we were aboard our ship, carrying the sarcophagus we found in the cave of the sun worshippers. Then everything went black... I wonder if there are any clues nearby? I'll bet it was the curse...",
  "18424": "Ah, I remember it all now! As we left the sunlit reef, the whale seemed angry and lashed out with its tail. Our helmsman must have panicked, as that's when we were wrecked! But that doesn't explain what happened to the artefact - or where the missing crew of the little boat went...",
  "18425": "I warned you about the curse! The artefact, it must be destroyed! Bente won't listen to an old sea dog like me - she'll put it on display, God forbid! For all our sakes, destroy it and end this blight!",
  "18426": "Oh, dear me! No sooner was the mummy exhibit opened to the public than a wave of disease seemed to wash over my lovely, happy city! Miss Sarmento has promised to find me some emergency supplies - please, you must help!",
  "18427": "Now I remember! It was our helmsman! He seemed on edge from the moment we departed the caves. No sooner had we left port than he steered us into a reef!",
  "18428": "Some of the crew went out on a dive to recover our navigation equipment... But when we winched them back up, all we found were severed cables! It's the curse, I tells yer!",
  "18429": "This monster! That explains the dreadful eerie noise we heard in the darkness, but it doesn't explain how we came to be wrecked here...",
  "18441": "A curse? Oh, how silly! Well, I'm glad neither of us believe in all that nonsense. Really, it isn't very fair on all those ancient civilisations that we always assume their legacies are nothing more than traps and curses. I shall immediately place this wonderful artefact on display for all to see!",
  "18445": "Thank you for saving my people! I don't know how I shall ever thank you. Curse or coincidence, I promise to be a little more careful in the future. The lives of the living are worth more than anything else. Please, take this vile mummy with you - I don't want to see it ever again!",
  "21736": "Look for the wild animals in the mountains on Bente's main island.",
  "16430": "I was elated with your western method of preserving edibles in metal boxes, but I cannot help but taste the tang of brass in the ones we produce... Is there a secret to it that is lost on me? I desire to savour the difference in your canned food.",
  "16431": "I am in awe of this horseless carriage. I understand it uses steam to move but... I do not comprehend how exactly it is done! I need to look at it more closely. Will you quench my curiosity?",
  "16432": "Where I come from, lacquerware is an exquisite art passed on for generation. I am utterly unfamiliar to this wood veneer of the other New World, but I would love to experiment with this foreign material. Would you be able to provide it?",
  "17984": "Oh, sweet explosions of golden orbs in my mouth! And I learned you have alchemists that extract the nectar and turn it into an enchanting beverage! May I be granted a taste?",
  "16433": "The brutes I sent to retrieve my last shipment from Madame Kahina's harbour brought nothing but shattered porcelain... Will you be the steady hand to bring me a memento of my childhood...?",
  "16434": "Friend, did you notice the terrible storm? My father sent precious presents to ease my homesickness, but I'm afraid they might have been torn from their course in the raging winds...",
  "16435": "Dare I dream my words will ever reach the Queen's honourable ears...? You are in good terms with her Sir Archibald, are you not? Could you bring my poems to him and maybe spare a kind word...?",
  "17986": "One of the things I miss the most is taking those long walks through the imperial gardens. I've been looking for curious and beautiful flora to garnish the grounds of my residence, and I hear Kahina has the seeds to grow pristine, cloud-like flowers.",
  "17988": "Oh, no... My mother sends ships carrying \"visitors\"... But I am sure their true purpose is much darker than that. Please, just... Bring them here discreetly, so I can send them back before they embarrass me.",
  "17989": "Sir Archibald sent me a note to thank me for the cookies, but I didn't send any! It must have been my mother... I know her - there is no way this gift had good intentions. Go there, and make the cookies vanish before someone cracks them open.",
  "17990": "Oh, the delicate perfume of brewing tea. I miss it so much it hurts to remember... There isn't a day I don't regret leaving my favourite kettle back home. I know Beryl, too, is an avid tea-drinker. Maybe she has a fine kettle she could spare me?",
  "17994": "I just received a report containing details of your trade history... But I did not order it, I swear! It must have been one of my mother's uncalled-for 'favours'. The spies must be roaming your harbour. I deeply apologise, in the name of my family!",
  "17995": "A beautiful flower that grows in the mountains has been haunting my dreams lately. I know I will not stop thinking about it until I can have some for my flower arrangements...",
  "16454": "Wind-swollen sails are such an inspiring image, are they not? I would like to capture the words of homecoming they whisper in the wind, but I cannot see the docks from my study...",
  "16455": "I remember the dolphins passing by our vessel when I first sailed to these lands, lifting every shadow of fear from my heart. Had I but an image of them to help me capture these emotions in a poem...",
  "16456": "I envy the wisdom of elephants in these troubled times. Could I capture their mighty essence in ink and paper...? I wonder maybe if a had a picture...",
  "16457": "My father has asked me to write a report about the wonders of the western railway system and its use in transporting oil, but I am at a loss for words at its technology. Could you take a picture of your oil harbour to illustrate my report?",
  "16517": "I do not recognise my father's kindness in these words, but this request for images of Sir Archibald's headquarters does bear his seal... Do you keep your camera still?",

  "16445": "My sister is coming to visit! She wanted to contemplate all the marvels I wrote about with her own eyes. I need to prepare for her arrival, will you escort her safely into my longing arms?",
  "16446": "I can never repay you for delivering my sister unscathed back to me. She is determined to experience every wonder hidden in this region. I told her many perils lurk beneath the surface, but she feels safe with you...",
  "16447": "No... My sister has been taken! I... never should have entrusted you with her precious life... I beseech you, help me mend my reckless actions. This is all the gold I own, exchange it for my sister's freedom and bring her back to me.",
  "16448": "Oh, is that all you have...? In that case, terribly sorry, but we do have a much higher bidder on this little princess' life.",
  "16462": "My family is forever in your debt, dear friend. My sister will remember the beauty of your home with a sweet smile thanks to your kindness. She gave me this token for you, please accept it.",
  "16460": "No, mei-mei! It... it cannot be... She only wanted to see her big sister's world... I will never be able to look at my father's face again... Our family is forever broken, thanks to you.",
  "16461": "I... I am at a loss of words. You do not understand how much you have done for us, for my family. I owe my sister's life to your selfless actions. The Emperor is forever in your debt, dear friend. I am.",
  "16449": "Father wrote. A close friend of the family set sail to deliver an important present to me... I am afraid this matter requires maximum discretion. Your ships will raise no suspicion, were you so kind as to retrieve it for me...",
  "16450": "Oh no... How could this happen!? The gift, it was stolen from your Queen! My mother's counselor has prepared a gift to appease her, in the hope we can send it through Sir Archibald, but I dare not venture there myself...",
  "16451": "Friend! I swear I know not what my mother had me send the Queen, but she stormed in here demanding I pledge allegiance to her! I will forever be despised in my country, but I have no other option... I must do this for my father...",
  "16453": "Father comforted my doubtful heart, but mother... She has sent imperial warships to clean the stain I put on our family's name! Her shadow already looms on the horizon... Aid me, friend!",
  "16463": "Is this what the Princess Qing would like me to hand the Queen on her behalf? Oh dear... Very well - I will make sure she receives it. Let us all brace ourselves...",
  "16467": "It is over... It was no doubt the Empress' hand that steered this unfortunate chain of events in an attempt to tarnish father's reputation. I still cannot believe I stood up against her... You truly inspire endless courage, friend.",
  "16468": "§--16468--§",
  "18004": "Father's always wanted to visit the Old World, but his obligations never allow him to leave his distinguished seat for long enough. I want to send him a piece of this land. The vessel that carries it, too, must represent the best of your culture. Do you have any suggestions?",
  "18005": "The way it sways in the waves so majestically... Father deserves nothing less! I will command my shipyard to start its construction at once. I know you want to help - could you bring us the materials?",
  "18006": "Nothing more beautiful ever sailed away from my shipyard. It's the perfect wrapping, but we still lack the gift... I've already had some ideas, but what would you suggest?",
  "18007": "Friend! What a magnificent treasure we've put together. Only one more thing remains. A masterpiece from the past - something that truly represents the history of the West. Madame Kahina has a good eye for such treasures.",
  "18008": "Oh, a present as grand as the land that inspired it, and as pre-eminent as the man that shall receive it. It is ready. Shall we gently guide this treasure home?",
  "18014": "Normally, I don't participate in the excitement of expeditions, but this time, they've returned with a treasure that intrigues me: a tablet written in a forgotten language. I presume Madame Kahina must speak every language, whether new or ancient...",
  "18015": "Oh! According to Madame Kahina's translation, the writing on the map points to a place in the middle of the sea. I need to know what lies beneath the surface! Maybe you have someone on your island who's studied the oceans, and might be able to help?",
  "18016": "Oh! This person does seem most capable of finding out what it is the tablet speaks of. I will mark the place on your map - let's see what you discover.",
  "18017": "I wouldn't believe it if I didn't hold them in my hands... Ancient scrolls, sealed under water for centuries! I will ask Madame Kahina to study them and produce their translations. I cannot wait to read these forgotten words! In the meantime, you can have the originals, as reward for all your efforts.",
  "19829": "Indeed, I know this language: it is from the ancient Aegeans. I will write a translation for the Princess, free of charge. I do enjoy these tasks.",
  "18026": "Our New Year is fast approaching! I would love to commemorate this passing of the year with something that represents both the fragility of time, and the technological advances of the era. Do you have anything in mind?",
  "18027": "How could you!? Clocks are terrible luck, especially if given as a gift for the New Year! I guess as a foreigner, you cannot be blamed... I know what you can do, though. I need some fine cloth to decorate the streets. Think you can you provide that?",
  "18028": "Oh, dear... How could you bring me white cloth!? This is a festival, not a funeral! Maybe just bring me some sweet refreshments, then. I don't see how you could go wrong with that...",
  "18029": "Grapes! What a pleasant surprise! This time you hit the nail right on its head: they symbolise abundance and prosperity. Thank you for all your help and efforts - now the New Year festival may begin!",
  "18000": "At first, I couldn't see past my heartbroken fog - but now that beauty has lifted the clouds from my eyes, I can recognise wonders I never could have dreamed of. If only more travellers from my homeland would feel welcome, and dare cast their anchor here...",
  "18001": "The greatest gift I could grant you, friend, is the peace and tranquility of listening to the soft tinkling of water running from a nice pavilion. Please try it, and let me know what you think!",
  "16388": "Princess Qing is doing her best to mimic the western way of preserving food in cans, but she believes she is not doing something right, for she perceives a metallic taste in the ones her company produces. She has asked you to bring her some of yours in an attempt to figure out what she is doing wrong.",
  "16389": "The Princess is terribly curios about the steam carriage. She would like to know more about how it works and has asked you to deliver some to her.",
  "16390": "The Princess would like to try using wood veneer to recreate the lacquered boxes from her home, she has asked you to provide it for her.",
  "17985": "The Princess loves grapes; they're one of her most relished pleasures. She's heard of a special beverage crafted from their juice, and cannot wait to taste it.",
  "16391": "Princess Qing's best tradeship has already ruined a perfect shipment of porcelain from Madame Kahina's harbour. This time, she has asked you to retrieve it for her.",
  "16392": "Qing's father sent her a ship with presents from home, but they never arrived. She has asked you to keep an eye out for them and retrieve whatever you find.",
  "16393": "Princess Qing has been working on her poems and wishes to have them read at the Queen's court. She has asked you to bring her manuscript to Sir Archibald and endorse her a little.",
  "17987": "The Princess longs to have a beautiful garden like the ones she had back home. She's heard of a beautiful flower that will fill her grounds with fluffy clouds, and would love it if you could get the seeds for her from Madame Kahina.",
  "17991": "The Empress has sent her daughter a visiting party from home, but Qing is certain they don't mean well. She'd like you to accompany them to her harbour with the utmost discretion.",
  "17992": "The Princess is worried that the cookies Sir Archibald received might be a less than kind present from the Empress. She's asked you to smuggle them out of High Clarence Hall, before tragedy strikes.",
  "17993": "The Princess misses her tea dearly, but she left her kettle back home. Luckily, Beryl too loves tea, so she figured she might have a spare kettle to lend her.",
  "17996": "The Princess has alerted you that her mother's been sending spies around, to gather information about your trade partners. They should be around your harbour area.",
  "17997": "The Princess' dreams have been haunted by a beautiful flower that only grows in the mountains. She wants to have some for her flower arrangements, but they're somewhat out of her reach.",
  "16394": "The Princess is trying to write a poem about sails in the wind, but she is finding it hard to capture the image without looking at them. She needs you to take a picture she can keep by her desk to find inspiration.",
  "16398": "Princess Qing remembers the hope and joy dolphins brought to her heart when she sailed for the Old World. She would like to write a poem about it, but she needs to remember the sight of them with a picture.",
  "16399": "The Princess needs help with her next poem. Her source of inspiration, elephants, lay far away from her reach, but you can help her if you take a picture of one.",
  "16400": "It seems like Emperor Qing is very interested in the railway system. The Princess has been tasked with writing a report about it, but she's asked if you could help her illustrate it by providing a picture of your oil harbour.",
  "16518": "Qing has been tasked with delivering a picture of Sir Archibald's island. She asked you to take it for her.",

  "16405": "Qing's little sister has reached her destination safely thanks to you, and now she feels it is safe for her to visit every corner of the region as long as your warships come along.",
  "16403": "Qing's sister is held prisoner by the mysterious attackers. She has asked you to deliver the ransom in gold and get her sister safe back to her.",
  "16404": "Qing's sister's kidnappers have refused to release her. There is only one way left to break her free...",
  "16406": "The Princess has received a letter from the Emperor telling her that a friend of the family was going to bring her a precious item. She has reasons to believe the situation demands discretion, and has asked you to retrieve it for her instead.",
  "16407": "The gift Qing asked you to bring her was a treasured belonging of the Queen! The Princess has asked you to deliver it back to Sir Archibald along with a present, as she doesn't dare to go there herself.",
  "16408": "Qing was set up and now the Queen demands that she pledges allegiance to her. She has no choice, even if bending the knee is against the Empress wishes, it is what she must do for her father, the Emperor.",
  "16410": "The Empress was not happy to hear her daughter bent the knee before a western ruler and has sent a fleet to attack her! Qing has asked you to back her up in battle.",
  "18009": "Princess Qing knows her father would love to leave his duties behind and travel the world. Unfortunately, the Emperor cannot afford to do so, and so she wants to send him a piece of the Old World, starting with a classical ship. Take a picture of a suitable one.",
  "18010": "The Princess loves your suggestion of building a ship of the line, and has already begun her preparations. However, she needs your help in gathering the materials.",
  "18011": "The ship is ready to set sail for the East, but first it needs to be filled with presents that represent the Old World. Qing looks to you for suggestions.",
  "18012": "The Princess is elated at the gift you're helping her put together for her father, but it still requires one more thing: a treasure from the past. She'd like you to go to Madame Kahina, and look for something that fits the bill.",
  "18013": "Qing's present for her father is finally ready to leave port. The Princess has asked that you escort it safely on its way.",
  "18018": "Princess Qing's expedition has brought back an enigmatic tablet written in an old language. She'd like to know more about it, and thinks Madame Kahina may be able to tell you more.",
  "18019": "The tablet found by Princess Qing's expedition seems to mark a place in the middle of the ocean. She'd like you to ask around your harbour, and see if you can find someone who can help you.",
  "18020": "You found a diver that will be able to search the ocean for whatever lies beneath the waves. The Princess has marked the spot on your map - go forth, and bring her what you find.",
  "18030": "The Princess is undergoing preparations for the New Year celebrations. She'd like to have something that represents both technology and time.",
  "18031": "Your last gift for Qing was not at all appropriate. Instead, she's asked you to deliver cloth to provide decorations for the New Year's festival.",
  "18032": "White cloth is a terribly bad omen to Princess Qing! You might get luckier with something to eat - something small and sweet, like a coveted fruit.",
  "18002": "Now that Princess Qing's homesickness has lifted a little, she's starting to really like the Old World. She hopes you could build a new public mooring, to welcome more visitors from her homeland.",
  "18003": "The Princess has recommended you build a gazebo by the river, in order to experience the peace and tranquility she was so used to back home.",
  "17790": "Take a photo of any sailing ship.",

  "9916": "Willie needs more fuel to help perfect his latest conjuring trick, a spectacular that sees him set ships alight! Even he admits it still needs practice...",
  "9917": "Willie is obliged to hand out pocket watches every time someone guesses his trick correctly. Unfortunately, this has been happening rather a lot lately...",
  "9918": "Willie has been taken in by confidence tricksters, it seems, who now extort him for gold. Better help him out before they get too rough on him.",
  "9919": "Willie seems to have become distracted during a routine trade, and his customer has *accidentally* taken all his timber. Perhaps you can help him.",
  "9920": "Willie thinks the reason his assistants keep quitting is because there aren't enough perks to the job. Perhaps delivering him some glamorous outfits might change matters?",
  "9921": "Willie has, perhaps foolishly, performed a magic trick involving a glass chandelier on a live audience. He hopes if you can deliver him some glass, it might go according to plan next time...",
  "18044": "Willie would like you to bring him some tobacco. He says it serves as an important reminder of the sacrifices his late mother made to get him where he is.",
  "18045": "Willie wants you to deliver him some fish oil to help keep his people fit and healthy. After all, that's where he gets all his strength from...",
  "9930": "A rival conjuror keeps heckling Willie during his magic performances, divulging the not-so-secret tricks of his trade. Willie wants you to help him get his own back, by exchanging Astronomo's vital props for junk.",
  "9931": "Willie could totally smash the great enemy his board has appointed for him - but since you're his best apprentice, he's kindly granted that honour to you.",
  "9941": "Willie has been pressured into criminal activity by his shady board of representatives, and is now getting his comeuppance. Perhaps you can defeat his pursuers, and help save his skin?",
  "18034": "Willie is yet again afraid that some vengeful spirits have returned to collect their dues from him, having sighted them near his shores. He hopes you can banish them.",
  "9933": "Willie's mum wasn't a believer in the five-second-rule, so depending on your own standards, he encourages you to pick up some goods that went missing on one of his trade routes.",
  "9934": "Willie's insistence on conjuring for the men aboard his flagship didn't go down too well, when the morning after his performance, he found all of his props had been thrown overboard. He hopes you might recover them for him.",
  "9935": "Willie has been told to look after some crates by his shady board, with the added condition he remain ignorant as to their contents. Now he wants to involve you in the mischief. Just be sure you don't look in the boxes as you deliver them!",
  "9936": "Willie has spotted some boxes out in the ocean. After last time, he doesn't want to risk being the one that steals treasure that belongs to someone else. Someone scary. He suggests you grab it instead - if you're brave enough.",
  "9937": "Willie is being pursued by the ghosts of his past, and wants to form a boundary of salt, provided by Madame Kahina, to keep them at bay. To be honest, it sounds like his garden just has a bit of a snail problem.",
  "9938": "Willie has taken a chance on a random assortment of high-value black market treasures, and wants you to help him celebrate opening them up.",
  "9939": "Willie has done a deal with a rough customer, who claims to not have the money to pay. Your job is to escort him home, and ensure he's as good as his word.",
  "9940": "Willie is worried that without his wand, a vengeful spirit roaming the earth will finally descend upon him, and take back a great treasure Willie once stole. He'll need protection until he can find his wand again.",
  "9942": "Willie needs you to escort a shipment, having guaranteed a client it would remain under his protection until it reached them. He thinks helping him will do you good.",
  "9943": "Willie wants you to defend his ship against evil spirits, while he gathers his powers to exorcise them for good.",
  "9944": "Willie is bemused by the reaction of the general public to his stage performances, especially given that entry is free. Help him keep those who wish to scupper his career at bay.",
  "9932": "Willie can't face carrying out what the shady board have asked of him. Instead, he hopes that if you take the assassination target far enough away, the board will be convinced he's done as they asked.",
  "18035": "Willie is bursting with pride over his newly-opened factory - he just wishes his mum could have seen it. Take a photo for Willie, and maybe she'll get her chance at one of his special \"spiritual evenings\".",
  "18036": "Willie is disgusted that you haven't yet got round to building a variety theatre, at which he might be able to tour with his magic show. He suggests you organise one as soon as humanly possible.",
  "18046": "Willie finally admits that what he's been missing all this time is someone to look after him and comfort him. Perhaps what he really means is someone willing to mop up his messes for him.",
  "18908": "Willie has come up with a tremendous co-operative venture with the lovely Bente. Although his idea seems rather a vague concoction, it might be best just to do exactly as he says.",
  "18037": "Willie recommends you invite Barnfield's Circus to your town, in order to spread happiness among your people. You'll need to build a big tent first, for which you'll need some light and cloth.",
  "18038": "Wilie thinks Barnfield's Circus can only recover its former glory if the existing freak show is replaced by the arrival of a performing elephant.",
  "18039": "Willie hopes that by escorting Barnfield's circus troupe to your harbour, the circus spectacular can begin. Watch out though - Barnfield's reputation as a ruthless ringmaster means he has his enemies.",
  "18041": "Willie has, perhaps foolishly, challenged a rival magician to a conjuring competition. As usual, he's in desperate need of your assistance. For this trick, he's asked you to deliver a lot of glass.",
  "18042": "Willie's \"Pepper Ghost\" trick was a colossal failure. He finally accepts he might have been too ambitious, and plumps for a supposedly simpler trick. He needs you to bring him a bowler hat.",
  "18043": "Having clearly lost the magic showdown, Willie does not enjoy being the subject of ridicule. Instead, he asks that you make his rival disappear once and for all.",
  "18047": "Willie tells you the story of how he became rich, having found a sizeable treasure which he now keeps under lock and key. The fact he doesn't know who it originally belonged to, however, has been keeping him awake at night. He thinks a vengeful spirit is haunting his lighthouse, and wants you to take photographic proof.",
  "18062": "You've given Willie proof of the phantom that stalks him, but now he wants your help to drive it away. Bring him some holy water from one of his baptismal fonts.",
  "18064": "Willie now has the holy water with which to face his demons, but unfortunately finds himself falling asleep. Could you help keep him and his soldiers awake with coffee?",
  "18065": "You are to pursue the mysterious phantom aboard his phantom ship, as Willie's quest to protect his fortune comes to its spooky conclusion.",
  "18066": "The phantom haunting Willie turns out to be nothing more than a few of the board's cronies, hiding under a sheet trying to play on his conscience. You should return the sheet to Willie as proof he has nothing to fear after all.",
  "18177": "Bente loves animals, I know that much. If she and I are really going to have a future together, we need to put those animals to use - at the circus! Please deliver her my, er... business proposition!",
  "18180": "Mmm... Still tastes... like childhood, doesn't it? I feel like I'm running down memory lane, my backside burning from the cane all over again.",
  "16816": "I'll come down on you like a tonne of bricks', that big old bully used to say. Well, let's see who has the last laugh now that we're all grown up, eh?!",
  "16817": "Alfred and Filbert are a lovely pair of shillings. Now, I couldn't remember if it were ten tonne or twenty owed. But being gents, they were quick to remind me it was thirty.",
  "16818": "My latest trick is called \"The Devil's Vessel\", a fearful extravaganza of sea fire! Got a bit hot the first time... 'specially for the crew... but it's getting there, it's getting there...",
  "16819": "\"A pocket watch says I can guess your card\", is how the trick starts. It should be impossible for them to guess it correctly as often as they do, though. Just bad luck, I s'pose.",
  "16820": "Asking for gold, I was sure it was the ghost, come for his due. Luckily, it's only a brigand - and he gave his word it'd just be this once!",
  "16821": "Lord Flattenflee and I were having such a cultured cultural chat, I think he loaded up a few too many crates by mistake! Haha! I've got loads more, of course, but... I do need those materials.",
  "16822": "I get through quite a few stage assistants... I mean, you know, they leave. Can't take the city lights and the glamour, I suppose. P'haps if they looked more the part, they'd feel more the part, and they'd stay?",
  "17085": "Woe is me! Jove and Juno converge upon me! I thought dangling those chandeliers above the audience was a genius idea, but it turns out it was the non-breaking sort of glass... Oh well. As mum always said, try and try again!",
  "18068": "I've probably told you already, but I do miss my mum. She might have been big and frightening, not to mention occasionally violent, but I was a real nincompoop back in those days. I deserved all of it. You know what reminds me of her the most? Raw tobacco from her evening pipe. Sends a shiver down my spine, it does.",
  "18069": "...me old mum used to take good care of me when I was sick, too. I remember those days in me straw bed, supping on stale— er, crusty — bread, and gobbling down spoon after spoon of fish oil. Wonderful. Perhaps if you have any of the old stuff, I could give a little something back to the sick and needy, in honour of me mum.",
  "16823": "Why'd he have to shout out how it's done?! Time that bully Astronomo got a huge kick up the interior, and had *his* show sabotaged for a change!",
  "16824": "I'm caught between a frog and a toad! The board want me to off a real dangerous geezer! I'm like David, he's like Goliath, but I've decided I'm going to leave all the glory to you!",
  "17089": "I did what they told me, and now look where it's got me! There's no port I can reach without fear for my life, and all on account of one little teeny, tiny little... robbery... thingy.",
  "18070": "I don't believe in coincidences. Those ships in the sea nearby must belong to the spirits I've seen; their eyes emitting a pale blue light, cheeks drawn and skeletal. Blow 'em up, would you?",
  "21958": "Eugh! You actually did it, and fished them out of the water!? That's disgusting! What are yer bringing 'em to me for? You picked the dirty things up, they're your problem now!",
  "16825": "Whoopsie-widdly-daisy, them supplies must have fallen overboard and got all wet. Mum always told me never to pick things up once they're dirty - but you can have 'em if you like!",
  "16826": "All my props are floating away! They say they chucked 'em because they was bored of my tricks, but we all know that can't be the real reason! Something sinister is going on! It's almost as if I'm not the one in charge around here!",
  "16827": "If I'm storing 'em, I should like to know what's in 'em. But it's me board, so we'd better do as we're told — save ourselves a lot of grief.",
  "17088": "I paid upfront for some of those mystery loot crate things, to be collected from a top secret location! And I have chosen you, to take care of the grand unboxing!",
  "18537": "Away from me, fell spirits! No, not you — you can help me keep these tendrils of the netherworld from reaching over my threshold! Salt from Madame Kahina is what I need, so I can fashion a boundary they cannot cross!",
  "18727": "As you may know, I have a good eye for treasure, and I've spotted some more at sea! 'Cept I won't go and get it myself, after what happened last time... Maybe you could go instead? If you're as brave as I was, that is!",
  "16829": "Guess I should have read the contract before signing, but you know, I think it's a good thing I agreed to protect every shipment. Keeps friends like you in work, eh!",
  "16830": "As the powerful sorcerer, I will be below deck gathering a magick maelstrom, while you, the simple soldier, hold off the fell spirits of the nether-realm until I am ready to banish them once and for all!",
  "16831": "Who could possibly want to destroy my stage props? I've never asked a penny for any of my performances, and this is the thanks I get! Just make sure my magical apparatus arrives safe!",
  "17087": "I may have remarkable powers, but I vowed only to use 'em for good. Mostly, anyway... Look - the board want me to do away with someone, and I just can't do it! Please, get them out of here would you?",
  "17090": "Just because someone looks mean and has scars all over their face, don't assume they're bad. He's just an honest fellow who forgot his wallet, is all. Go and double check on him, would yer?",
  "17091": "Oh, where is my wand?! Could have sworn I had it at Kahina's yesterday... *Sigh*. Guess it's a good thing I have you here to defend me instead. Without my wand, I'd never manage to protect myself if it — the ghost, I mean — came back to reclaim its rightful dues.",
  "18072": "Oh, if only my old mum could see my assembly line... It was only a thousand over budget! Hang on a minute... maybe she could? If you take a photograph, I could use the power invested in me to show her it during our next seance!",
  "18073": "What do you mean you haven't got a variety theatre? It's on my tour bill — the 2nd, the 17th and the 24th you said! We were all really eager to come by with our astonishing new act, so you'd better be ready!",
  "18074": "Like I said, Mum used to do a lot for me. Keep my socks together, comb my hair, rinse my bedpan. I don't have anyone like that around me now. D'you think, maybe... you could find me someone? Not a replacement, like — I mean no-one can replace mum. Ha ha.",
  "18911": "Lady Jorgensen is great with animals, while Willie is the best with magic! This is a huge opportunity in the making!",
  "18909": "Willie wants a circus? To put animals on display, and make them perform for us? To make a freak show of them? So sad that he, of all people, cannot see the wrong in that.",
  "21755": "Ah yes, even Willie gets lonely every once in a while. None of the maidens I recommend tolerate him for very long, since he has a bad habit of taking them for housemaids. Still, at least dear Lucy is a qualified one!",
  "18178": "A fitting welcome for my menagerie of peculiarities! Much better than that interfering Wibblesock - he's really been walking a tightrope with me!!",
  "18075": "As a man almost great as me once said, \"the noblest art is that of making yourself happy\". I had Barnfield's Circus come to town and cheer me up — and you should too, since you're looking so down. First, they'll need a big top!",
  "18076": "Barnfield is making the tent as we speak! Sadly, he was telling me yesterday that his freak show hasn't really drawn in the crowds as of late. What he really needs is an elephant! That'll really trumpet a new era of success.",
  "18077": "Everything's set for your circus! All you need to do is to escort Barnfield and his troupe to your harbour, and let the festivities begin! Watch out though - there's a few animal rights people mooching around, angry about the business with the elephant...",
  "18179": "Ohhh! Cables and mirrors is how he did it, eh? Ha! Well, no point wasting the secret of his spectacle now he's gone, is there?! By the way, you make an excellent assistant. Would you be interested in a more permanent role? You'll get a Wibble Soc. badge!",
  "18078": "The Ethereal Edwin Hartebeest shall vanish from the conjuring scene once he sees the wonderful Willie waving his wand! I shall win this magical tournament in whichever way I can. For my first joust, I'm going to need a lot of glass.",
  "18079": "How was I supposed to know which bit was air and which bit was glass? Anyway, it's going to be an absolute nightmare to clean it all up - and all while my rival Hartebeest conjures up something devastating! I need a quick and easy follow-up trick. Bring me a hat.",
  "18651": "Behold, before your very eyes, a disappearance of a magnitude never before seen! A whole ship VANISHES!",
  "18080": "Impossible! How did he do that! Now everyone's calling my act rubbish. I call upon you, my faithful assistant, to excommunicate this dark wizard! And also... find out how his tricks are done...",
  "18181": "A prank? White sheets? Nooooo! You think I, a noteworthy magician, would not have absolute faith in what I saw in that photograph? On the occasion of that fearful visitation? I must remain vigilant. Still, I appreciate all you've done for me. You've gone to great lengths for Willie and the Wibble Society, and I must acknowledge that. Did you get your badge in the post?",
  "18081": "Never told you how I made my fortune, did I. Well... I found something. A great treasure. Quite near the family home, actually. No idea who it belonged to - but only now do I learn it's been foretold that one day, its owner shall return and take bloody vengeance upon me! Only yesterday, there were reports of a shadow stalking about my lighthouse. Perhaps you could catch the phantom on film?",
  "18082": "THERE IT IS! I KNEW IT! Now you've no reason to disbelieve me like everyone else does. We must find a way to dispel this ghost. Hey! What about holy water? From my church, like?",
  "18083": "You know when you're so afraid, it makes you sleepy? Well, there's no point us having holy water to fight the phantom if we've fallen asleep when it floats nearby. Have you got anything to help keep our eyes pinned open?",
  "18084": "The ghost! I saw him, I swear! He was here in my room, white as a sheet over my bed, and wailing madly! I threw some holy water at him, and he yelped and flew from my window to his ghostly ship! What does he want with me? Please, help me face this spirit and try to reason with him!",
  "18085": "Oi, take it easy! Since you've managed to catch us, you must be a bit sharper upstairs than your chum Willie. Obviously, we're not vengeful spirits that walk the earth - just some hired hands they paid to put the fear of god up him. Here's the sheet we were under - take it as \"proof\" if you want. He still won't believe you.",

I will write back to George right away!

  "18494": "<br />Isabel, dear child. You have grown so much since first I met you — the ferocious jaguar cub that you were. You had lost a brother, and I, a father. I still had the years on my side back then, and the bounce of a free man in my step. But I owe it to you to tell you, the price I paid for that freedom was a high one. I never found the courage to tell you before now, but as the ever-quickening spectre of death approaches, I believe it is time. <br /><br /> You always knew I had to be a runaway slave. Well, in order to escape the plantation, I had to kill a man. The one holding the whip. That man was your brother. I had to kill him to set us all free — a decision I have had to live with ever since, though I have to say, at the time I never saw it as a choice. I know I came to you soon after, bearing the gift he intended for you, your name and his on the label, and I told you the lie that he'd died fighting in the resistance. I said he'd fought bravely against La Corona. The truth is, he was just a kid who'd fallen into the slave trade like so many others. <br /><br /> Well, that's all I can really say. May you find it within yourself to forgive me for depriving you of your only brother. Either way, I shall continue to support you until I draw my last breath. <br /><br />Yours, as ever, <br /><br /> Mr. George Smith.",

Never too old for play, never too old for love — and that's a word a slave barely knows, but for the little game of stones that used to bring us together.",
  "18480": "I think I've told you some of my story, so I may as well continue. I have spent a much larger part of my life than anyone would like, wondering what it would be like to be free. That was the New World; a place where a struggle for freedom seemed to be taking place in every root and leaf of every tree around us. Somehow, that struggle for light is still going on.",

  "17661": "Trust others, dearie, but never blindly. I dropped a little walnut for a squirrel to pick up. If this ship gets attacked, we'll know the squirrel is a rat.",
  "17662": "Oh, I know enough about banks to not entrust them with my own gold. I have a much better place to store it - somewhere far away from here. Do you think you'll be able to get it safely out of the region without succumbing to temptation yourself...?",
  "17649": "Surely you don't see any harm in having a little card game with my tea guests? Escort my colleagues, will ya, and make sure they're not spotted by any member of the so-called \"law-enforcement\".",
  "18149": "Our local fish are splendid. Served in every reception room worthy of notice, if you catch me drift. We've received a rather large order, though, and I wouldn't want this coveted delicacy to fall into the hands of pirates now, would I?",
  "18150": "Oh, dearie, did I ever tell you about my good old friend, Sergio? We just had the most interesting of discussions. Nothing should happen to him on his way back home, oh no. Nothing at all...",
  "18151": "Only faith has brought me comfort in difficult times. Pater Fidias has shown interest in visiting us, and he will be received here with the greatest of honour. You wouldn't mind keeping the good man safe on his way to do his holy duty, would you?",
  "18153": "A lifelong rivalry will finally come to a lovely end today. Ah, what better way to unite two families than a wedding? Still, the law does say that the nuptials must take place on neutral soil. You wouldn't mind lending the bride and groom a small patch of your island for their special day, would you, dearie?",
  "18154": "I like the Empress' style. A ship that bears her seal is on its way here to ensure Qing receives certain... benefits I can grant. It'd be a shame if its cargo were to get lost at sea...",
  "18155": "Oh, good, you're right on time! Do me a favour, and take these crates out of the region, quick! What's in them? Haha, only ten tonnes of none-of-yer-damn-business, sweetheart!",

  "18157": "(TBC - Quest not yet written)",
  "18158": "Don't you love horses? I adore horses. Specially when they win for Beryl. This jockey, though, could use a little encouragement. Would you mind delivering him a little present from me? Careful, it's delicate!",
  "18159": "How sweet of Sir Archibald to take care of an old lady like me. He's prepared something for me at his harbour, but I wouldn't want anyone to believe I enjoy a preferential treatment from the Queen... Could you go pick it up for me, dear?",
  "18160": "I keep my enemies close, and my friends even closer! Your help has been invaluable as of late, dear. Take this as a small token of my affection. And please, drop by every once in a while and have a tea with old Beryl.",
  "18161": "Ah, poor, dear Willie. I so often worry if he's doing alright. I just can't help it! I gave him some advice on how he should be running things on his island, but I worry he might not have got it quite right yet. Could you take a picture there and show me?",

  "18165": "(TBC - Quest not yet written)",
  "18173": "I... Oh, how could I have been so blind? The priest reminded me of my dear Walter. He would never have approved of giving our daughter away to a horrible family like the Butchers. I'm going to call off the wedding. And we'd better prepare - I doubt they'll take the news kindly.",
  "18166": "I had to sacrifice so much to dig us back up from the dirt after Walter passed. We had to come back from the city and fend for ourselves. And now Scarlet, that brat, can't even do one simple thing for her mother... Bring her back, please.",
  "18167": "Thank you for bringing her back. Don't worry - I'll make sure this spoiled young woman is ready for her nuptials. The groom is on his way, but there are still some brows frowning upon this wedding, and it's quite essential that he arrives here in one piece, dearie.",
  "18168": "Good - all set! Now, I have only one more thing to ask of you. See, my side of the deal involves providing a not insubstantial amount of weapons for this other family, but my production has been rather slow as of late. I'll be needing a few more, if you don't mind.",
  "18169": "You got the weapons? Good, good... Now the Butchers will settle down. Scarlet's refusing to leave her room unless our old priest, Charles, officiates the ceremony. She's insisting I speak to him. I'm already up to my eyebrows - could you find him for me?",
  "18172": "Well, colour me surprised. The Butchers sent a fleet to destroy Beryl the betrayer! They forget I still have their eldest son! Haha, let's sink them, dearie. No one will dare go against the O'Maras ever again!",

  "14145": "Gasparov wants hundreds of gramophones, so he can try playing them all at the same time and create polyphonic soundscapes.",
  "16952": "Gasparov has realised he needs to recreate his commission of fine chandeliers from scratch. The light bulbs had imperfections in their manufacture, and now he needs replacements.",
  "14146": "Gasparov has finally cracked. Some pirates have taken up residence nearby, undermining the beauty of his island - and thus, he wants you to destroy them for him.",
  "18182": "Gasparov has been left infuriated yet again by the persistence of pirates during guided tours of his island's unique monuments and sights. He hopes you are able to provide an escort, and sweep any ne'erdowells out of sight if they pop up during the tour.",
  "14147": "Gasparov wants you to rescue a bird with golden eyelashes that his men lost at sea. The composition of the spectacular golden salon he's designed will not be complete until the bird arrives.",
  "14148": "Gasparov wants his autobiography written in a most magnificent leather tome, in true medieval style. There's a wreck from the early 15th Century he wants you to investigate, as it's meant to contain a set of bibliographic tools left behind by some monks.",
  "14149": "Gasparov has asked you to collect something he ordered from Madame Kahina, worried that if he goes himself, he'll simply get lost in there, marvelling at all the joyful objet d'art.",
  "18188": "One of Gasparov's prized collections of hats seems to have gone missing, and its absence from his wardrobe is beginning to hurt him. It would be a great service to him if you could recover them.",
  "14150": "Gasparov is expecting a renowned pianist to perform, and wants to guarantee - given the rarity of his public appearances - that he arrives at the concert venue safely.",
  "14151": "Gasparov has completed a fabulous design for a tropical house of the Royal Botanic Gardens, and wants it securely transported to Sir Archibald in case a rival architect tries to steal his idea.",
  "14152": "Gasparov has pipped all the other bidders to the post at auction, and spent a vast quantity on some prized 15th century marbles. Unfortunately, he's now paranoid that without an escort, the slighted bidders may try to rob him of his new treasures.",
  "18189": "Gasparov would like to have a troupe of musicians play for him when he has his baths. Bring him some willing performers to add a little romance to his evening rinse.",
  "18190": "Gasparov would like you to organise a fashion event for him, for which you'll need to provide: escort for several noteable designers; a suitably chi-chi audience; and models that are pleasing to the eye.",
  "18195": "Gasparov would like you to ensure that a school of fragile ballerinas are kept safe from harm while in transit to his conservatoire, where they are to enjoy a formal performance routine from the master himself. Gasparov hopes that through ballet, some connection to the grandeur of the past can be preserved, even in times of great change.",
  "18191": "Gasparov would like to reaffirm his feelings of self-confidence, which are known on very rare occasions to dip temporarily. He's invited you to collect some of his adoring fans, so he can spend the evening hearing their fawning praise, and thereby restore his ego to maximum.",
  "18193": "Gasparov has made some fine invitations for some persons of high culture he wishes to attend one of his current exhibitions. He calls upon you to deliver them with great care.",
  "18194": "Gasparov is disappointed that an Eastern princess has confiscated a trio of exquisite vases so they can be returned to their point of origin. He would like you to bribe those tasked with returning the vases, so that he can restore them to display in his galleries.",
  "18196": "Gasparov is tortured by the possibility that followers of the despotic Alonso Graves freely roam his city, and that this heralds a coming apocalypse. He asks you to find them, and remove them from his city before the fall of man begins.",
  "18183": "Gasparov wishes to modernise the public sculptures in his city, and has identified several sculptures he'd like you to dismantle, which he believes to be artistically obsolete.",
  "18197": "Gasparov is embarrassed to discover you have no monument to show off to the world, and recommends you start constructing one, if you don't want to be left behind.",
  "18198": "Gasparov wants you to prove you can maintain your cellars of champagne. Having only a few bottles here and there just makes you look like a society fraud!",
  "18199": "Gasparov is disgusted at the number of statues in your city that were not designed by him, and wants you to destroy these false idols at once.",
  "18200": "Unsurprisngly, Gasparov wants you to build the statues he designed, rather than those of his rivals. He also wants you to do it right away.",
  "18201": "Gasparov is looking for a cover image of his island to sell a few copies of his newspaper. He believes the sheer beauty of such a photograph, taken by you, cannot fail to win over any of his doubters.",
  "18202": "Reluctant as always to leave his work and his island, Gasparov would like a photograph of your monument so that he can assimilate anything he deems worthy into his own designs. At least he's honest.",
  "14153": "Gasparov has been told by his psychoanalyst that he needs to get out more, and in particular, to take in the sea air. He would like someone to go boating with.",
  "14154": "The rolling sea has sent Gasparov into a panic - he worries he may be permanently separated from his work, and demands you escort him back home.",
  "18204": "Collect a renowned painter by the name of Van Ruff from Sir Archibald's island, and safely transport him to Gasparov so that he can capture the great man in portrait.",
  "18205": "An exasperated Gasparov wants you to track down the thieves who stole Van Ruff's paintings. Once they are returned to the artist, he might agree to produce Gasparov's portrait.",
  "18206": "On discovering the thieves have already sold off all of Van Ruff's best pieces, Gasparov suggests you visit Madame Kahina, whose knowledge in the area of high value art auctions is unsurpassed.",
  "18207": "His paintings returned, Van Ruff has agreed to produce Gasparov's portrait, and is currently in the mountains, soaking up the inspiration. Gasparov has asked for an update on his progress.",
  "18208": "Gasparov has heard of a particularly special tailor who knows how to make the most of cheap materials, and wants to see what she has to offer in person. He wants you to escort her to his island.",
  "18209": "Though the materials she's requested to work with are expensive, Gasparov is full of admiration for the bravery of the new tailor. In particular, the minimalism of her style. He asks you to find her what she needs in order to create him his own bespoke garment.",
  "18210": "Gasparov is naked - totally naked. It seems that instead of weaving him an outfit, the tailor he trusted has simply run off with all the riches you provided. Yet Gasparov seems blissfully unaware, and asks you to take a photograph of him in his \"new clothes\", so that this... enduring image can be shared with all.",
  "16961": "Gasparov is planning to construct the most ambitious statue ever unveiled on Sir Archibald's island, High Clarence Hall, and wants your help with the materials for the statue's foundations.",
  "16962": "Gasparov's ambitious project to build a modern colossus will be worthless unless he has the best living sculptor working on it. Mssr. Raisin was last seen indulging himself at Madame Kahina's Emporium.",
  "16963": "Gasparov's ambition to build a modern colossus has run into a small hitch. Armand Raisin, the only sculptor Gasparov will consider, has caused a scene at Kahina's emporium, and will have to be released from prison if the project is to continue.",
  "16964": "Despite his undeniable talent, Armand Raisin has not been quite as reliable as hoped in his sculpture work. Still, a bit of gold can cover up anything, according to Gasparov.",
  "16966": "Gasparov has got himself so caught up in the magic of the grand unveiling of his Colossus, he's forgotten to arrange transport for his distinguished guests to the unveiling Sir Archibald is hosting.",
  "17428": "Everything I've heard suggests this Armand Raisin's behaviour at Madame Kahina's fine establishment was despicable. The only artistic talent I see is one for painting the gutter, so if you want him, you'll have to pay.",
  "16939": "How could they forget something as simple as windows! You know, it is the one thing that's kept me from achieving my World's Fair — from reaching my zenith!",
  "16940": "Are you the catering people? We'll need champagne, and lots of it. Mssr Vichyssoise could arrive at any minute, and I need that investment!",
  "16941": "Within a room, a mirror, and in the mirror, the room - to infinity, but with sound! Like the groan of mother nature giving birth at the moment of creation!",
  "16951": "The wretched things are sealed into the crystal! Now I'm going to have to start these chandeliers all over again! This time, you'd better damn well bring me lighting that functions!",
  "16942": "Nothing is more vulgar and despicable than the sailor. Their debaucheries are an insult to my towers and temples! Banish them from my threshold!",
  "18211": "I will not have my island tour ruined by pirates yet again! Those barbarians don't realise the importance of my guests being fully immersed in my work, so as to form a meaningful connection with it! I want you to escort the group, ensuring only the right sort of people are among them!",
  "18238": "Oh dear... Is this really what they looked like? Honestly, I had no idea how tawdry and mundane this particular line of milliner fashions had become. At least, I suppose, I can look forward to punching my fist through the lot of them.",
  "16943": "I sent fifty-score hunters to capture the bird with the gilt lashes, and no sooner was it found than those incompetents lost it at sea! Bring it to me, and my golden salon shall be complete!",
  "16944": "I've been hearing ever more rumours about that wreck. As you know, only the finest monastic era inks, writing implements and vellum paper will suffice to illuminate the true and complete history of me and my miracles.",
  "16945": "Browsing Madame Kahina's marvellous emporium is the only real pleasure I ever allow myself. However, if I collect my order myself, I shall be in there forever, when vital projects need my supervision!",
  "18213": "Where have you been?! My darlings are lost! Lost, I tell you! An entire collection of made-to-measure hats and headpieces that cannot be replaced! The last time I saw them, they were in excellent condition, and still more than capable of impressing that feeling of timeless grandeur upon all who lay eyes upon them.",
  "16946": "It is a VERY rare treat when mon ami Frederic Chaplain performs. You must therefore attend to every detail of his cavalcade so that nothing - NOTHING - is left to chance!",
  "16947": "There are petty rivals of mine who might try to steal my plans for the tropic house of Her Majesty's garden, as they claim I did theirs. Make sure the plans arrive safely!",
  "16948": "They are, of course, priceless. But since I beat the others to them at auction, I want you to keep them under wraps until they're safely returned to me. The jealous are everywhere!",
  "18214": "Bath time is a time of reflection for me. I watch as ideas evolve in the sparkle of the water, glimpsing beauty in the mirrors and mosaic tiles. To hear music then could only heighten the sweetness of that self-absorption, as if my genius were resonating with the gently-strummed lyre of Apollo himself.",
  "18215": "Dr. Fraud has suggested I hold more social gatherings and events, so that I remain in regular contact with other... people. I have chosen you to prepare a festival of fashion in my city, for which I want the finest clothes, and therefore, the finest designers. Oh, and there'll no doubt be a few accessory tasks as well.",
  "18219": "Where are the ballerinas? Only they have the power, in this era of tumult, to leap gracefully over the terrible chasm between tradition and modernity! I shall have to do some stretching beforehand of course - it has been a while - but I hope these young and fragile talents aspire, at least in some part, to my degree of mastery over the form. ",
  "18216": "I have been receiving some critique as of late that I've taken rather to heart. I think I need someone to massage my ego - to tell me I'm wonderful, even though I know it already. I keep a little circle of adulators I like to call upon for such occasions. Bring them here safely, so I can hear my name spoken on glowing terms once more.",
  "18217": "I have taken the utmost care in having these card invitations to my upcoming design exhibition printed. It is therefore upon you, as a common courtesy, to keep these very fine etchings from smudging, bending or creasing in any regard, as you deliver them to the chosen few.",
  "18218": "I cannot bear to see such beauty torn away from those specially-commissioned pedestals! I don't care if her people made those vases in the first place - they've changed hands a hundred times since, and yet this is the first time anyone's expressed any regret that they were missing! What I'm trying to say is, why me?! Please, persuade them somehow to relent!",
  "18220": "I see civilisation crumbling in their bloodshot eyes; great monuments to thought and ideas toppled by their scabby hands. The followers of Graves must be removed from this sacred place, before they incite some barbarous counter-movement, based on nothing more substantial than a skull motif!",
  "18212": "Gargoyles and meat-limbed eyesores! I don't know what whoever built these sculptures was thinking! Tear them down this instant!",
  "18221": "Grand monuments are an opportunity for eminent persons to show they belong among the elite. I suggest you get yourself one - or the foundations, at the very least - unless you intend to diminish evermore into insignificance?",
  "18222": "I am still cringing from hearing the news about your stocks of champagne. Have you any idea how embarrassing it is in polite society to not have a full and complete cellar of vintage? First impressions are everything, everything!",
  "18223": "The shame of it! I make the most beautiful statues in the known world - most likely, even the unknown world too - and yet you insist on parading the feeble stone splodges of my rivals? I don't think I shall be able to rest until you've smashed them all to tiny bits!",
  "18224": "Since your city is unsullied by the hideous statues of my contemporaries, why not take this opportunity to build something of genuine verve and elegance? If that's not clear enough, I mean I want you to build my statues on every street corner!",
  "18226": "My island is so picturesque at the moment, it's simply begging to be photographed. I cannot even begin to imagine how many copies the next newspaper edition would sell based on having my island on the cover alone. So set up your camera, please, and remember that I will hold you personally responsible if you fail to capture its essential beauty!",
  "18227": "I can't spare time to visit, of course, but I still want to see your monument, so I can decide in which respect I want to massively improve upon it. Bring me a photograph that shows the edifice from all angles, so I can cherry pick any ideas I deem worthy of iteration.",
  "16949": "Dr. Fraud believes some bracing sea air will do me good. He thinks I spend too long cooped up in my bureau, poring over my magnum opus. Can you show me the sort of place he's talking about?",
  "16950": "What if I were lost to these waves forever!? Gasparov, drowned and forgotten?! Reunite me with the shore this instant, or I shall never forgive you!",
  "18239": "I don't deal in fine art. Too cutthroat for me - these days, at least. But I do know some art merchants that were almost certainly involved.",
  "18240": "It was such a relief to have my paintings returned to me - thank you! Indeed, you may have arrived at the perfect time, as I think I've finished my portrait of Gasparov. Here!",
  "18241": "What? What is this!? A crude and vulgar piece of amateur sketchwork!? But I had it on good authority that this Van Ruff was a real talent! Seems to me that he is nothing but an impostor on the art scene, with the hand and eye of a labourer! If you dare speak a word to anyone of this indignity, this travesty of a painting, so help me!",
  "18228": "It's the name that I like more than anything: Van Ruff. I haven't seen any of his work, but from the reports of Sir Archibald, I'd be a fool not to have him attempt my portrait! Bring him here, so I may sit for him.",
  "18229": "The heathen is refusing to paint me! Something about not showing his work in public again after thieves stole his paintings! Excuses, excuses and yet more excuses! Return Van Ruff's paintings to him, and I will have my portrait!",
  "18230": "Those artless brigands have already sold off Van Ruff's pieces, and at ludicrous valuations! I can only think Madame Kahina might have some knowledge of the movements and whereabouts of work of that magnitude.",
  "18231": "Finally, with most of his work returned, Van Ruff has agreed to paint me. He is in the mountains at the moment, finalising his sketchwork. I'm very busy, as always - can you check in and see how things are progressing?",
  "18232": "I have heard rumour of a tailor who can produce the most fabulous garments from the humblest of materials. I've always admired good clothes, so please, could you bring her here.",
  "18233": "She's quite something that tailor. You see, the material she showed me is luminous enough to be almost imperceptible, so finely woven it is. Of course, she says she'll rely only on the finest materials - as the best always do - when fashioning me a costume of my very own to wear. Would you hurry along and source the materials she needs?",
  "18234": "The tailor says it looks absolutely perfect on me! Perfect! Everyone I've shown it to has lowered their heads, in what can only be described as deference to the divine! No matter that it was so expensive - what matters now is that I am so photogenic! Please, capture me on film, so that the world may embrace the emperor's new look!",
  "16967": "My Colossus! A true successor to the giant sculptures of classical tradition, and perhaps the work closest to my heart — it is made of stone, after all. The Queen herself has asked for it to be built at High Clarence Hall. The sketches are finished, the bozzettos made - now, I just need materials. First, for the foundation...",
  "16968": "I cannot hope to outdo the greatest sculptures of all time without utilising the best possible sculptor. Perhaps Armand Raisin can be found - as the best always are - at that delightful emporium.",
  "16969": "You must see Armand released! It's inevitable that he is on edge when he's had so little stimulation! As you know, however, I have the perfect antidote in mind — my Colossus!",
  "16970": "My Colossus must be indulgent. Lavish! An excess of gold will make up for almost any slips that Raisin has made. I should never have permitted him to work in such a bohemian manner!",
  "16971": "My Colossus... Finally, it's finished! Finally, I shall take my place amongst the select pantheon of architects. And you... you... Yes, well, you may bask beneath my golden rays - once you've ferried the dignitaries to their private viewing at High Clarence Hall.",
  "17427": "You looking for Raisin? He's back on the green fairy again... Caused such a ruckus, they had to take him down the cells.",
  "17843": "Look for the sculptor on Madame Kahina's island. He is in the gardens, close to the huntress statue.",
  "2381": "\"I am awaiting new police officers...\"",
  "2382": "\"You might want to get an impression how your facilities work\"",

  "17489": "Carl doesn't believe you've progressed far enough to need all the bricks you're producing, so he wants to keep them for himself.",
  "17490": "Carl finds chocolate disgusting, but knows how important it is for hob-nobbing with the rich and influential at his soirées.",
  "17491": "Carl would like you to bring him some heavy armaments, believing shows of force are an important tactic in keeping his workers quiet and obedient.",
  "17492": "Carl wants you to deliver some quartz sand, so that he can make his workers' gruel go further. Ideally, he hopes it'll make it seem so unappetising that his workers will forgo eating entirely.",
  "17502": "Carl has devised a scheme to sell brass as gold. It seems to be going so well, he wants you to bring him some more of the stuff.",
  "17539": "Carl is so mean, he even wants to charge his workers for the clothes they work in. He thinks if they come from you, his workers won't join up the dots and see how unfair that is.",
  "17555": "Carl has no scruples about tricking his workers into working longer by installing some light bulbs. He just needs you to bring him some, so he can get to work.",
  "17616": "Carl's initial plans have stalled due to a shortage of timber. He demands you bring him some, since you probably have access to plenty.",
  "17617": "Carl seems to be building a vault in the mountains with the intent of hoarding his ill-gotten gains. By providing wood and steel, you would be helping him connect the vault to his empire by rail.",
  "18662": "Carl has become acquainted with a very nice old lady, who just so happens to be extremely rich. With no husband or children to take care of her, Carl has offered to step in and help. He'd like you to organise a gift of coffee, so he can keep her company in the afternoons.",
  "18663": "Carl is running out of patience looking for gold in the New World, and would like you to deliver some dynamite to him to speed up the process.",
  "17619": "Carl has identified a threat to his business in the shape of up and coming competitor, Cuthbert & Co. He thinks sinking one of their key shipments might just have the same effect on their prospects.",
  "17620": "Carl is denying any knowledge of a debt that someone claims he owes. Rather than pay it off, Carl asks if you could make the matter go away - whatever that may mean.",
  "17621": "Carl is furious that a group of workers are trying to start a trade union to protest against their mistreatment. Fearing for their lives, they're conducting their meeting out at sea.",
  "17622": "Carl is disappointed that news of his cities being polluted is being reported in a local news outlet. He wants you to put these hurtful stories to bed, once and for all.",
  "17623": "Carl has been snubbed in business. He wants you to hunt down the one who outbid him, so that he'll get the contract instead.",
  "18664": "Carl has heard one of his vessels has been wrecked at sea. Blaming it on the sailors, he asks that you ignore any survivors and just recover what's left of the cargo.",
  "18665": "Carl has noticed that his shoreline looks a little dirty, and would like your help in a beachcombing effort to clean the place up.",
  "18666": "Carl has concocted an insurance fraud, which requires you to destroy two of his empty ships and keep some sort of evidence of the accident. He then intends to submit a claim for both ships, as if they were fully laden with goods...",
  "18667": "Carl has lost a ship in imperial waters, and seems to think this makes the accident the fault of the Queen. He wants you to gather what remains of the ship to support his legal case against the crown.",
  "18668": "Carl's police have identified the instigators of a recent riot in his settlement, and he wants you to escort them through the angry crowd to jail.",
  "18669": "Carl thinks he's found a machine that will greatly increase the profits from his factories, but he's afraid others may want to steal the secret designs - unless you can protect them.",
  "18670": "Carl is astonished at your shortage of banks. He wants you to build more - not just for your sake, but for the sake of the economy!",
  "18671": "Carl is disgusted to hear that the Royal Council intends to pass a law that reduces working hours, and wants you to secretly replace the proposed edict with an idea of his own.",
  "18672": "Carl is looking for an island in the New World with gold on it, and would like you to take a photograph if you find one.",
  "18685": "Carl has managed to pass a local bylaw that lets labourers work from a younger age, and recommends you do the same.",
  "18687": "In order to assess your worth, Carl wants to know if you can sustain a healthy balance in your business ventures - or if you really are as incompetent with money as he always thought.",
  "18679": "It's dawned on Carl that his letter of proposal to Bente Jorgensen may never have arrived, and he urges you to deliver a replacement.",
  "18681": "Not content to read between the lines of Bente's letter, Carl assumes she's playing hard-to-get.",
  "18682": "Not to be denied, Carl decides to make a second dress to woo Bente, this time like the sky at night as she described.",
  "18683": "Desperate to be rid of Carl Von Malching's greasy advances, Bente asks you to deliver a letter to Carl. In it, she tells Carl she will marry him, but only on the condition that he renounces his family name, and any claims to any titles he may have.",
  "18688": "Due no doubt to some insider tip-off, Carl believes the price of cigars is about to go through the roof, and wants to get his ships to Madame Kahina's unhindered so that he can buy up all her stock.",
  "18689": "Carl bought his cigars from Kahina, thanks to the escort you provided, and now he thinks it's time to sell. He wants you to do it for him, though one can't help but think there's something funny going on.",
  "18690": "Carl's cigars turned out to be imitations made of wax. Understandably, his clients are not too happy about it.",
  "18691": "The Queen and Sir Archibald appear to be ignoring Carl's claims to the title of Baron. He asks you, as a fellow person of standing, to make the case to Archie on his behalf, along with a pleading letter.",
  "18692": "Carl confesses that the documents Sir Archibald needs in order to verify his claim to a barony are still lost in the nearby mountains, where his first wife had her carriage... accident. He wants to avoid going up there himself.",
  "18693": "Sir Archibald seems satisfied with the basic evidence of Carl's claim to a barony. However, he wants proof Carl will come to the aid of the Queen in her hour of need.",
  "18694": "Upon hearing that all he needs in order to claim his barony is for his old family castle to be restored, Carl asks you to fetch some materials so he can start building right away.",
  "18695": "Realising he can't afford to restore the family castle, Carl asks you to photograph something else instead, and take it to Archie pretending it's just part of the refurbishment.",
  "18696": "Sir Archibald is finally ready to admit that Carl can have his barony. All that remains is for you to escort Von Malching to the ceremony.",
  "3137": "You, lumberjack, bring me more timber! There's a bottleneck in my prime opening strategy, and I keep running low. House Von Malching used to own entire forests, until the state repossessed them!",
  "2385": "Choo-choo! The locomotive of progress splinters the bones of inefficiency! Deliver wood and steel, or I shall derail with impatience!'",
  "3095": "I'm always aware about security in my realm...",
  "3583": "I happen to need all the bricks I can find for a gigantic smog of new factories! Besides, what ambitions could someone like you possibly have for some bricks?",
  "3586": "With plenty of potent cannons dotted about, my workers will remember their place, and my profits will be launched into the stratosphere!",
  "3587": "I curate an exclusive party for the grotesquely rich - that's me - but those damn chocolates are in fashion! I abhor the obnoxious, sticky cubes - so you can get them for me!",
  "3859": "You know, I've recently learnt that very few people actually know what real gold looks like. The fools have never seen it! On a totally unrelated note, do you think you could bring me some more brass?",
  "3861": "If they want work rags, they'll have to pay for them themselves! If you were to bring me some stamped with your clothing label, they'd never realise how perversely unfair this whole arrangement is!",
  "3863": "Lightbulbs, with their glorious luminescence, shall dangle from my every factory shack from here to Mandalay, so that my workers have no idea what time of day it is!",
  "3864": "Everyone but an idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept hungry! To make sure my workers can never again complain that their food is lacking in texture, I intend to cut it with Quartz Sand!",
  "18698": "I've met an older lady I absolutely adore! If I had some coffee, we could spend the afternoons together discussing her great wealth, and also, perhaps, the apparent lack of an heir to it...",
  "18699": "I haven't found anywhere near as much gold out in the New World as I'd anticipated! There must be something you can bring me to speed up the process of destruction and deforestation?",
  "2993": "I don't like how quickly the trading company Cuthbert & Co. are growing. If a key shipment of theirs were to go missing, I should think their trading days would be numbered!",
  "3645": "People I have never before laid eyes upon come to me, a Baron-to-be, and claim I owe them money! I'm counting on you to set my slanderous accusers straight!",
  "3646": "The worthless workers have agglutinated into a secret 'trade union' out at sea, and are voting on better conditions! Fewer Hours! Safety Measures! This makes a mockery of the social order! I want it dissolved!",
  "3647": "That nosy news-monger has once again belittled my city! He says the air is thick with pollution! Rubbish! I know for a fact that minerals in the air help strengthen the lungs! Skewer that polecat before he can print another word!",
  "3649": "That filthy swine has backed out, claiming he's had a better offer! Well what if this \"better offer\" were to suddenly disappear?",
  "3143": "If the crown rules the waves, why have the waves sunk my ship!? Is the Queen as feeble as King Canute? Bring me proof of the wreck, so I can sue her and that Blake chap for all they have...",
  "3775": "You, sea comber! I have need of an unwashed whelk to scrape up the foetid debris from my otherwise-impeccable sea dunes!",
  "3832": "Amateurish jack tars who couldn't handle a few waves, it would seem. Apparently some have survived... but what do I care! Bring me back my possessions!",
  "3833": "Once you have destroyed those two empty ships of mine, you are to recover the debris. That way those insufferable amoebae from the offices of law won't question my insurance claim! I'm expecting a full return, including remittance for the non-existent cargo!",
  "3901": "My police should have the instigators of those riots lined up and shot! But, it seems gaol will have to suffice. Take them away, and pay no attention to the angry mob!",
  "3902": "Imagine getting your mitts on a machine that does the work of a hundred weaklings! No more factory rats, snivelling and complaining! Keep the ship that bears those blueprints safe!",
  "18700": "What do you have against banks? After a while, it's the only thing worth building if the divide between rich and poor is to reliably grow!",
  "18701": "The Royal Council is about to pass a law that allows workers to take days off! Just when I thought they couldn't get any lazier... I want you to go there in secret, and replace it with my own, much more sensible legislation...",
  "18702": "Imagine how much gold must be out there in the New World - oh, I can just hear it gleam! If you do happen to see an island with an aura of the auric, do take a picture of it for me...",
  "18703": "Alas! The child, no more than ⁬eight, and wasted by fever struggles weakly against the wind, as another grueling day at the mill begins... Sound like excellent business? Then here - exercise this edict, and never suffer seeing a child idle again!",
  "18704": "What kind of competition are you? If your financial accounts are anything to go by, I'd say 'measly'. Or perhaps you can show me I've underestimated you...?",
  "18719": "I can't just keep putting that odious man's leery letters in the fire... He may eventually come rapping at my door in person *shudders*. Please, take this letter to him, and say that while I am grateful for his offer, I cannot accept.",
  "18720": "Then the dress is ready. The moment she sees it, she will wilt into my waiting arms.",
  "18721": "Some may find that pretty... but perhaps it may surprise you to learn that I prefer a dress dark and laced with mystery, like the sky at night.",
  "18722": "I cannot deny this is a beautiful dress, but... I never imagined he'd have it made. Oh, please help me! I cannot marry him, I will not marry him! But wait... an idea occurs to me... I shall write to accept his proposal of marriage, on condition he renounces his name and titles!",
  "18723": "Renounce my rightful claim to barony? Further disgrace my family name!? The girl is mad as a box of frogs! She's madder than my last wife, and we all know what had to happen to her... Sorry, I mean, what accidentally happened to her.",
  "18706": "The only possibility is that my offer of marriage never arrived, else I would already have received Miss Jorgensen's effusive letter of acceptance! Promise you'll be more reliable than the last nitwit postman...",
  "18707": "Oh, I see! It's clear from her letter that she's just being coy. I shall woo her with a gift that oozes opulence... A dress fashioned from sun-glist threads, and gold. Huhuhuhuhuh.",
  "18708": "She, too, must enjoy the thrill of the chase! If she wants a dress as glittering as the milky way, then that is what she shall get!",
  "18709": "I cannot deny this is a beautiful dress, but... I never imagined he'd have it made. Oh, please help me! I cannot marry him, I will not marry him! But wait... an idea occurs to me... I shall write to accept his proposal of marriage, on condition he renounces his name and titles!",
  "18710": "As I'm sure you know, I am a master of the markets - and I sense the price of cigars is set to skyrocket! Quickly, get me to Madame Kahina's post haste, so I can buy everything she has!",
  "18711": "Good, good... Now it's time to sell these sought-after cigars. Perhaps I could leave the actual selling to you? Though I recommend you don't let them see the actual merchandise before you've made your getaway...",
  "18712": "Why is this box so light? Wait a minute... they're all fake! Don't think you can trick us and live to tell the tale!",
  "18724": "I do sympathise with Carl, but I'm afraid covering yourself in feathers doesn't make you a cockerel. The only chance he has of succeeding in this matter is if he can provide formal evidence to support his rather audacious claim.",
  "18725": "Did Mister Von Malching really defeat those enemies of the Empire singled-handedly? I must say, it all seems rather suspicious, you coming to me in his stead each time. Still, I may have neglected to mention, but he could never be a baron without a castle anyway...",
  "18726": "Hahahahaha! They have no idea how little, and yet how much I deserve this... Finally, I'll be Baron Von Malching at last! I do hope you'll keep all the juicy details of how it came about a secret...",
  "18713": "I have waited long enough! My polite requests to restore my barony to me seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Take this letter to Blake, and use all your puny powers of influence to force their hand!",
  "18714": "I knew that stuffed bird would want proof. Well, the truth is the family scrolls fell down the mountainside during the... accident. *Carl erupts in melodrama* Oh, woe is me! Forsooth, I cannot return to that cursed place, lest I discover my lost love roaming those hills. They say she still shrieks my name, as was always her terrible habit.",
  "18715": "Sir Archibald was forced to admit that my family lineage suggests I am due a barony. But now he's muttering something about defending the Queen should the need arise. Sounds like a job for you, not me...",
  "18716": "They keep finding ways to dodge my perfectly legitimate requests, don't they? Well, if it's a castle they want, a castle they shall have. While I work out how to restore my family castle to be even grander than the royal palace, you go fetch me some materials!",
  "18717": "I... I can't rebuild the family castle! It's far too expensive! And the maintenance costs I'll incur later on... Hold on, I have an idea! I'll take a clipping of a palace from this cheap novelette. Take this, and pretend it's part of the new renovation! They'll never know!",
  "18718": "So this is Von Malching's family castle? It certainly looks different to my memory of it. I gather he opted for a more modern design, which shows commendable practicality. Well, I see I have no choice but to give the man what he wants. You'd better bring him here...",
  "21959": "Look for the remains of the accident in the mountains on Carl von Malching's island.",
  "3166": "Alonso would like some bricks for a maze. Seems like some sort of initiation, or a test of faith for his disciples...",
  "3165": "Alonso would like you to bring him some more schnapps, it would seem, to put the disciples at his door into some ritual trance.",
  "3167": "Alonso is after a few more animals he hopes will help him predict the future. He wants you to deliver some to him.",
  "3589": "Alonso wants you to fetch him some pigs for a bathing ritual that those in civilised society might call gruesome, but that he assures you is good for the skin.",
  "3677": "Alonso would like you to bring him some bicycles in order to conduct some macabre experiment on those unwise enough to follow him. It also involves his pet tigers...",
  "3590": "It's coconut season, and Alonso Graves and his merry band are having difficulty getting them open. He hopes perhaps you can provide a simpler solution.",
  "3886": "Alonso has decided its time for a new eating regime for his following, and would like you to deliver a very unlikely combination to get them off to the best possible start in the mornings.",
  "3164": "\"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall.\"",
  "18466": "Alonso wants champagne. He seems well aware of what a contradiction to his philosophy it is to need such an intensively cultivated product, but is willing to forgive himself in order to experience such a divine sensory pleasure.",
  "3172": "Alonso wants to test your animal instincts when bearing down on prey, and has asked you to stalk down one ship in particular. But watch out! The herd are likely to band together against any would-be predators...",
  "3685": "Alonso wants to escalate a conflict between two local warlords, who each wish to prove themselves worthy of becoming his vassal. Of course, Alonso wants to be sure he only picks the one who'll be the better 'partner'.",
  "3686": "Alonso wants you to destroy... him. Or one of his ships, at least. Why? Well, your guess is as good as anyone's.",
  "3688": "Alonso is dismayed to discover that the crew of a ship belonging to a local warlord has been interfering with the local dolphin population by feeding them fish. There is, of course, only one natural response to such provocation.",
  "3689": "Alonso is looking for strong swimmers among the new recruits, and would you like to put them through their paces with a little impromptu military scenario training.",
  "3879": "You find Alonso in extremely bad humour. Though he seems to believe it's already too late, he hopes you can help remove the weed that is the Empire from his locality.",
  "3881": "The noise from a merchant's ship seems to have interrupted Alonso's meditations one too many times. He doesn't care that the cargo is for him - he just wants it destroyed.",
  "18472": "Alonso has given you the opportunity to use a pirate flag, meaning you can attack anyone you like and they likely won't know it was you, rendering any peace treaties you may have meaningless.",
  "18484": "Alonso wants you to let go and stop worrying about which ships you destroy, and why. The important thing is that you are destroying them.",
  "3179": "Alonso has heard of a sunken ship from the east, which bears treasures and goods of interest to him. He'd like you to go and fetch them.",
  "3180": "Alonso compares a royal frigate that has run aground nearby to a fallen stag, and wishes to waste no time in stripping it of its best military assets.",
  "3834": "Alonso's decision to place mines in the locality seems to have paid off. He asks you to help him make an assessment as to what remains of the enemy.",
  "3843": "Alonso hopes you can help him recover some travellers who've wandered off the beaten track. They're sure to prove useful to him... one way or another...",
  "4116": "Alonso is concerned for the wellbeing of some of Her Majesty's diplomats who somehow shipwrecked nearby, and hopes you can lift them into the warm safety of the rescue vessel he has provided.",
  "17073": "\"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall.\"",
  "4105": "Alonso wants to test how good your instincts are when it comes to spotting an ambush. He's going to pounce on a ship of civilians, and he wants you try and keep them safe.",
  "4114": "Alonso secretly likes having such a powerful battleship, and wants you to accompany him on a little mission to see exactly how all-conquering it really is.",
  "18486": "Alonso would like you to take some of the younger generation on a boat trip through dangerous waters, believing that it'll do them good to know the truth about what they're up against.",
  "18495": "Alonso would like you to deliver a small token of his affection to the latest woman he's become infatuated with.",
  "18496": "Alonso has asked you to deliver a feast to his waiting guests, who are waiting to hear what happened to their countrymen.",
  "18497": "Alonso is sending you around the houses to spread a message of fear, but insists it must be done quickly, or the whole thing will be a disappointment.",
  "18498": "Alonso would like you to smuggle a surprise into Gasparov's city, as a reminder of the impermanence of our species' existence and legacy.",
  "18499": "Alonso would like you to deliver some compensation to a woman in the area, whose husband appears to have met with injury whilst working at the factory.",
  "18514": "Alonso would like you to take a picture of Bente's zoo for him to give to her as a gift, so that she knows he's there for her.",
  "18515": "Alonso has set your harbour on fire so that you'll have some burning news to share in your morning papers. He wants you to be the first reporter on the scene, and to photograph the destruction.",
  "18518": "Alonso offers you one of his unwanted playthings to collect, which no longer gives him quite as much pleasure as it did at first.",
  "18520": "Alonso Graves, a former soldier in the Imperial Army, has asked you to collect a secret weapon from him, which he plans to use on his former masters. He hopes it will serve to remind the Queen and her followers that they must live with the consequences of their wars overseas.",
  "18521": "After the Great Purge, Alonso asks you to bring him some wood to help him light a church bonfire. He believes bathing in its light will help cleanse any feelings of ill will among his people, and to realise this difficult act was all for the greater good.",
  "18524": "Alonso asks you to decide which lion to feed a La Corona spy he has caught; Jean La Fortune or Isabel Sarmento. You get the feeling he wants you to intercede more generally in matters of morality, since he himself has no point of reference.",
  "18525": "Alonso asks your advice once more in deciding which of his long-serving disciples finally deserves to be 'freed'. To be perfectly honest, the outlook seems rather bleak for both...",
  "18526": "Alonso asks you to make another moral choice. Do you save a goodly priest, or a trio of convicts?",
  "18527": "In this final episode of his moral meanderings, Alonso has sent a ship laden with disease to your harbour. He asks you to decide whether it's better to risk allowing it to fester, or to rashly blow it away with the dynamite he's provided. Better brace yourself either way...",
  "18528": "In this final episode of his moral meanderings, Alonso has sent a ship laden with disease to your harbour. He asks you to decide whether it's better to risk allowing it to fester, or to rashly blow it away with the dynamite he's provided. Better brace yourself either way...",
  "18529": "Alonso invites you to collect the legal fees he feels he owes you.",
  "16877": "I need more bricks. I build the mazes with bricks, you see, so my little blind mice can bump their way around, like a big game of blind man's buff - only in many respects, one that's much more entertaining.",
  "16876": "They must have more of the holy balm! I cannot be the scrying portal, the mirror to the other realm, when the pupils in their heads are not lost to the blackness of the void, their bodies not limp and servile.",
  "16878": "I need some cattle. Do you ever consult haruspices? You really should, you can learn an awful lot. Sadly, I'm still a novice - I find myself sifting through many animals before I even begin to see the truth emerge.",
  "16880": "Please, I must cleanse myself, for all our sakes, in the uncorrupted essence of animals. When you read about what liquids swilled about in the bathtubs of the ancients, you realise bath time could be so much more fulfilling!",
  "16881": "If I give my men bicycles, can they escape starving tigers? It's a test, you see: man versus nature. Science versus the universal. Of course, you'd be more than welcome to join us - but first I need those bicycles.",
  "16882": "If you watch a monkey opening a coconut, the whole thing seems so natural. Effortless, even. Give a coconut to the Queen of half the world, on the other hand, and she has absolutely no clue. My men are much the same. You'd better bring me some dynamite.",
  "16883": "If it's true what they say, and we are what we eat, I don't think my disciples are eating properly. Bring me texture, bring me body. Bring me something to get their juices flowing...",
  "16884": "\"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall.\"",
  "18467": "Champagne is such a guilty pleasure. A real sin for a man like me, who's always so quick to reject anything that reeks of 'civilisation'. I'm sorry, but it's not my fault it tastes so wonderful! I just can't resist all those tiny bubbles tickling my tonsils!",
  "16897": "You are a crouching fox. An infant rabbit flops into your clearing of peril. It's eyes are wide, but blinded by fear. It runs, you pounce, and you wring its neck! That's if the mama and papa rabbits don't catch your scent first...",
  "16900": "I have found two rutting stags, two rivals who long to be my mate! I want you to stab their haunches, and make their passions race!",
  "16901": "Destroy me. Burn me. Each scar the cruel, licentious blister that is man. Drown me. I long to swim up from below, a vision appalling yet pure, like the thorny creatures of beelzebub!",
  "16902": "Look at those dolphins cavorting behind their boat, bellies stuffed full of fish they should have been catching themselves. Working together to beat them up from the sea bed with their tails. We are a corruption! A plague! We must all be destroyed.",
  "16903": "In time, the sea and smoke will rise. Dreams of Atlantis will dash on the rocks. Just man killing fellow man, until the sea washes over their heads. I need you to gather the ones who float. The rest are pointless.",
  "16904": "We could have reached upward like honeysuckle; opened in perfect uniformity like a fragrant meadow of hibiscus, but instead we grew into foul weeds, just dying to be severed at the root!",
  "16905": "Their clocks scream in my mind. Foghorns, pigcrap hawkers. Crumple these trader automata - their schedules will shatter my visions no more.",
  "18483": "Here's a pirate flag for your ship. I know you long to kill anonymously and with impunity, so I'm just making the whole thing easier for you. Don't you see - nobody will know it was you! Hahahahaha. You're free! Hahahahaaha!",
  "18485": "Maybe they're good people, maybe they're bad people. What does it matter? I know it's a difficult idea for you to swallow, but once they're dead, it really doesn't matter which side they were on.",
  "19905": "Wow. I didn't see that coming.",
  "16906": "A ship from the east. The tea leaves say it has sunk. There's powdered bone of tiger and milk of poppy aboard that would be great servants to me, and I'd be grateful if you could retrieve them.",
  "16907": "When a mighty stag falls, who for many years had been warden of his forest, it cannot be more than five minutes before some resourceful insect wanders by, and realising what rich meat lines the carcass, plunges in his proboscis.",
  "16908": "Well, it sounds like those sea mines have exploded alright. That means I could use some help. Do you like to count? Most people like to count, it's reassuring — our coins, our friends. So come, don't be shy — help me count those bodies.",
  "16909": "I hear the bleating of sheep nearby, who find themselves... quite lost. I would gladly welcome them over the temple threshold. We can sit them down, give them jasmine tea, and talk about all the different possibilities that might await them here.",
  "16910": "Those poor, drowning creatures. I just want them to have some hope of rescue, that's all, even if only for a moment. Perhaps you can be the one to save them from a fight for their lives?",
  "17074": "\"I always asked myself how an antler would look at my wall.\"",
  "16911": "Why don't we play a game? A ship of innocents is coming this way, and I am going to assault it. You will be their saviour - the guard of honour to shield them from my savagery!",
  "16912": "\"An impregnable fortress\", they call my battle crusier; unsinkable! Ah, the hubris of man - there is no string in this universe that will not unravel, no star that will not one day die. Nothing can stop the end.",
  "18490": "There comes a time in every young boy or girl's life that they must come to terms with the world in which they have been cruelly abandoned. To see first-hand the crimes committed in faraway lands in the righteous name of empire. Perhaps you can break the bad news?",
  "18500": "I have discovered a woman of great bosom and beauty, one whose arching red soul bridges to mine across a chasm of leeching decay. I feel the need to tell her how I feel; to show her how my heart beats for her!",
  "18501": "Hello, pigcrap. I would like you to offer up a dish of morsels and a few goblets of claret to some guests of mine. They were hoping to hear what unhappy fate has befallen their compatriots, and I feel obliged to let them know.",
  "18502": "You always seem busy, pigcrap. So much to do, so little time! Well, I have something to keep you on your toes...",
  "18503": "Perhaps you can remind Artur of a matter we once spoke about. I tried to explain the futility of 'legacy', you see. That all we are, all we create, will turn to dust. But for some reason, he seemed quite afraid at the idea. In my opinion, the man needs his head examined. Hahahahaha.",
  "18504": "I owe someone an apology. I've been taking care of her husband for months now, you see - but yesterday, unfortunately, I was forced to let him go. I know you'll be there to remind her, however, that the news is only half-bad.",
  "18506": "What!? This food ...WHAT IS THIS HORROR?! You mock us, boy! Prepare to meet thine end!",
  "18507": "I need these delivered while they're still hot, you see. They'll remind my old friends that I am alive and well, just hiding under the bed, ready to RATTLE. Watch out, though - the people I took those from probably want them back...",
  "18508": "From Graves? What could it... NO! William! Please no, not my William! What... inhuman monster would send only his torso?!",
  "18516": "Dear Bente loves her zoo. I often watch her through the bars; the way she floats among her gentle creatures, a sparkle of curiosity in her eyes. There must be some way to show her I am no different. I am a wild and savage beast that must be tamed!",
  "18517": "Isn't it dreary when you open your newspaper in the morning, and there's no disturbing headline; no affirmation of all the chaos you know is bubbling under the surface? Well, good journalists always sniff out a story! Better hurry to your harbour, hahaha!",
  "18519": "At first it was a toy to give me thrills, but I soon got bored. Maybe I just don't have the patience? Still, you look as though you need cheering up - so come and get it!",
  "18522": "The Empire sent me to hell, and I came back... changed. I was stretched to within an inch of my life, saw lifelong friends roasted over fire like thanksgiving turkeys, and what for? What for?! I want them to feel as I felt. To feel their lungs fill with char, to witness their towers of Babel crumbling all around them.",
  "18523": "Now we have purged the earth of wickedness, we must make a bonfire. Purify ourselves. This is not a petty vendetta. This is a realisation, for all mankind, that we are doomed, and I don't want that on my conscience.",
  "18531": "What is right, and what is wrong? Does anybody really know? Out here in the sticks, you lose all sense after a while. Anyway... I caught a La Corona spy, your honour. Should he dangle for Isabel, or for Jean?",
  "18532": "Interesting interpretation... but I don't judge. Now, if I may beg your further counsel - two of my disciples wish to be free, after many fine years of service, but I'm afraid I can only save one of them. The decision is too painful for me, so I'd better leave it to you.",
  "18533": "I know, I know. It's so hard living with the choices we make, isn't it? Say there was a wonderful, wonderful priest, and three wicked, terrible, bad prisoners drowning. If you had to choose, which would you bring me to be saved?",
  "18535": "It's difficult, isn't it? Still, I think you made the right choice. The perfect fuel for those cruel winter nights you get in the old world!  Hahaha! One FINAL thing. When the black death descends, do you let it play out, or purge it with a great fire?",
  "18536": "I've prepared a small gift, to thank you for your guidance in these difficult times. So much is going on inside my cranium, I sometimes think it might suddenly POP!",

  "18050": "King Alfonso, Vicente's superior and La Corona's head-of-state, is angry that the Queen is hogging the best fish and fishing grounds. Vicente has asked you, as a neutral, to sink a merchant vessel in the sound where the so-called poachers have most often been spotted. He needs proof to take back to the King.",
  "18051": "Vicente wants to enlist you as a mercenary to fight in the wars against the rebels that are trying to break away from the Old World Empire of La Corona that Vicente ostensibly serves. From Vicente's tone, this seems to be a critical coming together, so you ought to be well-prepared.",
  "18052": "Vicente wants you to look for the rebel commander, who was not counted among the dead in a recent battle, and whom he therefore believes may still be hiding in the sea where the battle took place. If you find him alive, there can be only one course of action.",
  "18053": "Vicente wants you to destroy a small trade ship carrying some street urchins he knows have stolen from him, even though the spoils of war they stole have already been moved on to their master. Vicente seems to have given up on tracing this mastermind, and is content for you to take his frustrations out on those immediately responsible.",

  "18055": "Vicente wants you to track down some deserters of La Corona. It seems he has a zero tolerance policy towards those who try to escape active duty, and intends to have them lined up and shot.",
  "18091": "Vicente has suffered a humiliating defeat. Still licking his wounds, he would like you to recover anything you can from the battlefield. It is his belief that, like with pastry, if at first you don't succeed, you should simply gather your scraps together, and try and roll the whole thing out afresh.",
  "18093": "Find the commander whose men mutinied against him, and bring him before Vicente Silva. Vicente believes having the commander watch his men pay the penalty for insubordination may help in his natural development as a leader.",

  "16810": "Vicente insists now is the time to strike the final blow against Isabel's rebellion. Or at least, this part of it. You notice he's committed most of his fleet to this end, and has perhaps unwittingly shown you the gap in his armour!",
  "17439": "Isabel curses Vicente's allies (whoops, that means you!), but has suggested that while Vicente's head is turned, there may be a chance he's left his home relatively undefended, and open to attack.",
  "18184": "Vicente would like you to deliver a proposal of an alliance to Bente Jorgensen on his behalf. Judging by his attitude, it seems unlikely even Bente would accept...",
  "18185": "The rather oppressive Vicente Silva has asked you to deliver some weapons to Bente Jorgensen, to indicate his supposed goodwill. You doubt it's a gift she'll be happy to receive.",
  "18236": "Vicente believes he's found a natural nemesis in Alonso Graves - a man who has done what no soldier should do, and gone against his country. Vicente is rather taken aback by Alonso's unpredictable nature, however, and hopes you can deliver a message to bait him out into the open.",
  "18237": "Sadly, it is Vicente who has never turned to face the light. To shake the confines of his own human ignorance. To feel his face burn with the intensity of his own disgust, and emerge on the other side, a free man.",
  "18090": "Vicente is an avid reader, though naturally preoccupied by the subject of war. He's heard in the officer's mess of a new book, written in your language about the art of war, and wishes for you to bring it to him.",
  "18092": "Vicente has no time for love among the ranks, and is rather irritated to discover the surveillance information he's been waiting for has been delayed by a lovers' tryst. He can't face the tedious lovebirds himself, so he asks you to extract it from them instead.",
  "18139": "Vicente wants you to scout ahead and photograph the rebel fleet in formation, believing this will enable him to develop a strategy for his attack.",
  "18162": "Vicente is regretting his decision to ally with you, noticing that you only have a tiny fleet. He suggests you hurry up and build two frigates, or he might have to think twice about the arrangement.",
  "18164": "Vicente is mildly disappointed to discover you aren't currently much of an ally, thanks to the lack of weapons factories at your disposal. He suggests you do something about it, or the alliance between you could come to an abrupt end.",
  "16739": "Not everywhere can a passing army pillage local villages for food and supplies, no! In the white expanses of the world, my men are going to march on bread.",
  "16740": "I have every sort of pen you can imagine: quill; stylographic; underwater; gold-iridium-nibbed - and I guarantee you, not one of said writing implements is mightier than a sword in close quarters combat!",
  "16741": "The threat my armadas pose should be absolutely transparent to the enemy! They're already a spine-tingling spectacle - all they need now is an even deadlier sting!",
  "18049": "A medal, the king said, for services to La Corona. Well... I see no sign of it yet - and I know why. The empire doesn't have enough metal to equip the army, that's why. Never mind us war heroes, flogging this dead horse of an empire. It's an insult! Bring me some metal, and we'll mint the damn medals ourselves!",
  "16742": "Now may not be the right time for a full-scale assault on the rebels in the colonies, but a gradual suffocation of the arms at their disposal shall serve me well for when that great day comes. Get to it, soldier!",
  "16743": "They'll never expect it! General Silva NEVER strikes out of the blue, those mindless rebels will say. But I can be spontaneous. I can be!",
  "16744": "One of the ships in the rebel supply convoy is being shielded by the others. I smell powder - lots of it! If you destroy that ship, you'll blow the rest to kingdom come!",
  "18056": "La Corona is losing on every front, but what is King Alfonso's greatest concern? Fish. He likes eating fish - but the Queen's fishermen keep drifting closer and closer to our waters. Of course, it makes no sense for me to start a war over it. What a crazy idea! You start it. And bring me proof.",
  "18057": "There is going to be a small skirmish. It's unavoidable, but very winnable. If you were to take part - as a mercenary, of course - it might just give us the edge over those pathetic rebels. Of course, you're a mercenary - you probably don't care who you kill - so it may as well be for La Corona!",
  "18058": "Well, we put them to the sword of course - but that made the waters course with blood and splintered timber, which made finding the enemy commander all the more difficult. If he's not among the dead, the clever fellow must still be out there, hiding at the site of the battle! Execute him.",
  "18059": "I have had the entire hoard from the battle of Cape Chance stolen from me by some devil-spawn adolescents, and given to whoever their gutter-born Fagin is. Needless to say, it won't be happening again! If they're old enough to steal, they're old enough to suffer for it - so go and make them suffer!",
  "18061": "There's more than one way to skin a cat. Young boys go in full of bravado, climbing over the trench walls with the ephemeral spirit of life aflutter in their breast, knowing this will be all or nothing. Those of higher rank stand a safe distance away, and pick off what remains of the enemy, before returning to their bunker for coffee and pastries.",
  "18063": "You know what I do to deserters? I do the kindest thing it is in my power to do. I have them executed. What kind of life awaits them otherwise? Knowing they have failed their family and friends. Failing to defend the nation they swore to defend; failing at being real men. You'd better bring them back here, hadn't you.",
  "18086": "I didn't think he'd attack if he saw me little regulars on board! Lucky they're all good swimmers. I've underestimated that Vicente - he's almost as heartless as I am. Hah! Only joking. He's a softie compared to me.",
  "18095": "Sometimes, when you take your big rolling pin - hnngh - and you roll out your pastry, it starts to crack up - hnggh. Bits... falling, on the floor. Hnngh. But you can't let that beat you. No! You have to pick up the pastry, SQUISH it up into a great big ball once more, and roll the blasted thing out again! HNNGH. Hnnggh. Hnggh.",
  "18097": "Mutiny, that's what it is! Unheard of! Hnnghh. Hnggh. One of my most subservient commanders, tossed into the sea by his own men. Find him, and bring him back here. I want him to be there for the court marshal and subsequent execution of his men, so he can witness how his weak leadership has caused this whole fiasco!",
  "16746": "Seek power, do you? It's better left to those born to it - those who understand the danger that follows it about. Come with me, and I'll show you what I mean.",
  "18118": "The old lady is plotting against me, I'm sure of it! My last three shipments of weapons were destroyed the moment they rounded the bay. This time, you'll be there to escort them, and you are to report any, ANY suggestion that Margaret Hunt is involved.",
  "18119": "I know they can more than handle themselves, but my fleet are just too busy and too important to be distracted by enemy outriders. That's where the grunts like you come in and take one for the team. Now, hurry, for the hour of triumph is near!",
  "16747": "I tricked you into sending your fleet to the edge of the world, and leaving all of your territories vulnerable to assault. How does it feel, now the horse hair has snapped, and the sword is falling upon you?",
  "16748": "The greatest horror I know — my nephew Nicolau — is visiting again, and I just can't face him. Please, take him off somewhere, I don't care where. And for goodness' sake — keep him on a leash, or my sister will throttle me!",
  "16749": "Kidnapped?! What!? No!!! Now I shall have to waste energy and resources negotiating his release, when I should be taking over the world! Grrrr!",
  "16750": "I have paid... a substantial amount... for Nicolau's release from those two idiots you let get their low-born hands on him. See that they never make it home.",
  "16751": "As I understand it, the great empire of the East is as unequivocal on the matter of damn rebellion as La Corona, so it makes sense for us to unite. Escort her here, but keep her identity anonymous!",
  "16752": "As much as I want to blame you, I have reason to believe my secret concord with our friends from the east was shared from within my own ranks. I guarantee that whoever that spy was, they will pay a very high price indeed.",
  "16753": "Sure enough, the one responsible for the breakdown of the Eastern promise left my capital at first light this morning. I want that spy hunted down, and served the only sensible penalty.",
  "16754": "No-one has need of privateers now. Frankly, I found it demeaning when La Corona employed them back in the glory days. In fact, I'm so sick of the sight of those toothless simpletons, I think I'll leave their demise to you.",
  "16755": "Seems like you've unearthed a stubborn little pirate in this Harlow woman, haven't you? Still, she is a woman, so I don't suppose she'll put up much of a fight.",
  "16757": "She's an impressive leader, I'll give her that. But since you've done half the job on her horde already, you may as well go the whole hog and erase the pirate scourge for good.",
  "16794": "La Fortune may not be an enemy of La Corona, but since your Queen doesn't seem to be imposing her authority over her protectorates, you may as well... accidentally... lay a few mines. On her behalf, of course!",
  "16795": "So, that minefield worked to thin out Jean's already limited forces pretty well... Now, heehee *rubs hands together*, we must destroy the better part of his fleet before the final assault on his island!",
  "16796": "You have him in the jaws of victory! Clamp shut, and the spoils will be mine — I mean, ours! Then we can telegraph Sir Archibald and let him know the bad news for poor little Queenie.",
  "17432": "Don't side with that lizard! You don't even have to care for our cause to see what a despot that man is! And oh, what a terrible loser - you have to see it to believe it!",
  "16803": "I have no idea how that woman, Sarmento, has become the greatest adversary of La Corona. It truly is baffling. If you can destroy her supply vessels, I'll know you can be trusted to see out the rest of my grand strategy for her.",
  "16804": "The thing about Sarmento is, she still attempts to position herself as a peaceful stateswoman, when it's obvious she uses methods every bit as violent as the rest of us. She must be exposed! If you could start a fracas, I shall have my newspaper pin it on her!",
  "16805": "You've impressed me with your loyalty so far. As such, I am prepared to divulge — in the strictest of confidence — the next stage of the plan for Sarmento. How do we begin? Preparation! The first and final rule in strategy. Today, we build the assault fleet!",
  "16806": "Now is the time, my young warrior! Throw your life on the line for La Corona, and all will be well! I myself have been somewhat daring too, sending all of my best ships to this crucial battle - but when you've made mincemeat of every threat in home waters, that is your privilege!",
  "17438": "Whoever's been secretly helping Vicente is a fool! We shook the old lizard's grasp off long ago. In fact... with all his forces heading for us, I think he's left the door open at home... Perhaps someone as clever as you might be able to sneak through?",
  "18175": "I would like you to deliver this letter to Bente Jorgensen. A beautiful woman should always be accompanied by an upright chaperone, born of a noble family - ideally one from overseas - who can do the difficult job of thinking for them, advising the best use of whatever small means they have.",
  "18176": "Everyone knows Bente needs protecting. So, why shouldn't I be the one to look after her? I am the best-equipped, after all. As they say, there's nothing a woman likes more than a man in uniform!",
  "18186": "From Vicente? Oh, how terrible! I mean, normally I welcome those extending the olive branch to be companions of mine. But he's just such an arse...",
  "18187": "Yuck, yuck, no, no! Get the repulsive things away from me! As I have told Vicente a thousand times, I'm a pacifist — although I'm starting to wonder if I should make an exception when it comes to him. Sometimes, I really feel like bopping him on the head with my brolly!",
  "18203": "None have I wanted to beat more than Graves. That traitor to soldiering — for which master, it matters not — tampers with the basic principles on which we are founded; the pyramid of society from highest to lowest. I want you to lure him into the open, and send a barge up the river to his heart of sin.",
  "18225": "So, Vicente wants to beat us out of the trees, does he? Like his drab pheasants falling limp into the brush at his estate. No, that's no good. Please, destroy his ship and return it to him. I have no desire to be part of his petty pantomimes.",
  "18235": "Hnggh. A coward, and no surprise! It was cowardice that drove him into hiding, and until the day he is ready to face his crimes against the good name of soldiering, a coward he will remain!",
  "18094": "We learn the basics from an early age, if we want to command. We attend fine military academies, we read all there is to read. Only then do we have the field upon which to pitch the tent of strategy. Find me a copy of \"Leadership after Nadasky\", and help me take the high ground.",
  "18096": "Good soldiers all too often find themselves distracted by the opposite sex. Those two lovelorn bores have been withholding surveillance information which is vital to the final victory of La Corona, and I need you to put the two pieces of the puzzle together!",
  "18152": "War feeds science, and science feeds war. Let us make use of the latest fad for photography, and capture the enemy formation in situ! Reconnaissance is a key part of good strategy - if I know how the enemy have deployed themselves, I'll know almost immediately how to crush them!",
  "18170": "Every day, I ask myself, what is the point of our alliance? Your fleet is pathetic! If I'd known I'd be joined at the hip to a loser, I'd never have signed our agreement! Now buck up your ideas, or I shall rapidly withdraw from this misguided arrangement.",
  "18171": "At no point when signing our alliance did you volunteer the fact you have not a single weapons manufactory in your possession! What kind of namby-pamby, lettuce-luncher are you?! Cobble something together at once, or I shall tear our alliance into ticker tape, and sprinkle it over your yellow jelly custard!",
  "13816": "Pick up the new weapon at Silva's trading post.",
  "17810": "Move a ship to Vicente Silva's harbour to receive a torpedo. Use it to destroy Jean La Fortune's targeted ships.",
  "17811": "Left-click on the torpedo to select it, then left-click where you want to launch it.",
  "17847": "Tip: Take down the cannon towers around Jean La Fortune's island first.",
  "17840": "Tip: Take down the cannon towers around Anne Harlow's island first.",
  "17841": "Make a decision: Either destroy Isabel Sarmento's ships, located in the New World at her harbour.",
  "17842": "Or, open the way to Vicente's harbour by destroying the few ships still left guarding it.",
  "11415": "\"Solve this and you will reach knighthood...\"",

  "3673": "Sir Archibald's favourite hobby is wood-carving. He's politely asked you to provide some materials.",
  "3831": "Her Majesty has had some hot-blooded guests come to visit. Being used to much warmer temperatures, they require a somewhat thicker attire.",
  "3846": "A much younger, more frivolous Archie Blake once bet a castle against a friend, and lost. He feels it's now time he paid his dues.",
  "3871": "Sir Archibald would prefer that certain enemy reinforcements never manage to reach the Movement's territory, if you could deal with the problem.",
  "3875": "There appears to be some sort of interference occurring between the Queen and one of her royal suppliers. Sir Archibald has commanded you to take care of the saboteurs.",
  "4113": "It seems that some criminals decided to steal one of Sir Archibald's least favourite pieces for their ship's figurehead. Too bad they decided to leave it unattended, as he'd rather see it sink than have it exposed to the general public.",

  "4124": "Sir Archibald innocently mistook one of the Dutchess' ships for enemies, and gave the order to sink it. He would like you to resolve the situation.",
  "4129": "Sir Archibald has heard Madame Kahina has some beautiful ebony for sale at her harbour. He would be deeply grateful to you if you could acquire some for his carvings.",

  "17095": "A delicate matter. Her Majesty has recently become aware of The Movement's ailing cause, and wishes to donate off-the-record. We trust you to keep it all quiet.",
  "17096": "I'm an avid wood carver, you know. Yes, give me a chisel, a fishtail gouge or a mallet, and I'm quite content. The thing is, I'm so keen, I've run rather short of timber!",
  "17097": "Having come all the way from the equator, I don't blame them for feeling the chill! Her Majesty will be most vexed if we don't warm them up!",
  "17098": "Believe it or not, I used to have something of a wild streak. Once, I even wagered a castle against a fellow - and lost! The rashness of youth... Better do the honourable thing and build it now though, don't you think?",
  "17101": "Delicacy is by far my preferred modus operandi, but certain occasions require one to... pound the cream from the eclair, so to speak. The Movement will suffer if enemy reinforcements reach the colonies. Ma'am wants you to make sure that never happens.",
  "17102": "Her Majesty has lost enough already, without also losing King Svalbard as a trade partner. The saboteurs of our once-doughty bond must be met head on!",
  "17103": "Would you believe it! The fools only stole the least interesting of my carvings to use as their figurehead! Since they seem to elsewhere at the moment, I see no harm in sinking such naive work, along with the bandit's vessel.",
  "17100": "First impressions are vital! It's unthinkable that the South Sea dignitaries should catch a whiff of piracy during their visit. Would you terribly mind clearing the waters for me?",
  "17104": "Oh, goodness! A storm's wrecked the delegation's transport! The treaty cannot be signed until they've been returned to my harbour! You'd better hurry down there with a good dose of smelling salts to revive them!",

  "17107": "Oh dear... I most certainly did not intend to mix up the Dutchess' ships in this ordeal. Could you manage this rather thorny misunderstanding for me, and send her my, um, sincerest apologies?",
  "17108": "Her Majesty received an alarming missive over her second breakfast - some threats to \"undermine\" her authority, quite literally. Perhaps you could bring the matter to a peaceful climax?",

  "17110": "Viscount Foxweasel has borne a grudge ever since I smothered him in manure at his public school initiation. I'm convinced he's planning to sink my exhibition of recent carvings. Can you ensure it arrives intact?",

  "15499": "Oh thank you, thank you. Saved indeed, saved!... You don't imagine the labour will be too arduous, do you?",
  "15500": "O' for a taste of distant shores and foreign lips, and the elegant shadows of slender leaves... Still, I cannot leave my earthly prison... To see that paradise, if only in a still picture, would take my breath away...",
  "15501": "My precious Annabel is about to commence her lifelong voyage of learning! She will shine a light so bright on the world— I must have a picture of her with her fellow pupils!",
  "15502": "Please, a photograph of us at the zoo! We may never again have the chance before our little Timothy succumbs to his illness.",
  "15503": "The grand opening! Finally, grandfather's canning plan comes true! A picture will inspire my own grandchildren to preserve...ha!...the business forever...",
  "15504": "Dubois would take my lovely Rebecca away, but I shall not let him! A photograph of the duel shall prove the lengths to which I am willing to go for her!",
  "15505": "I have seen all there is to see! And if the museum ceases to stimulate, I am left with naught but my inner monologue, and little in life terrifies more than that!",
  "15506": "This is one of my great favourites! I have long sought a like-minded soul with whom I might share it!",
  "15507": "Ah, the turbulence of the past is never quite so dreadful as that of the present! Indeed, I find these ancient artefacts of war quite romantic - and I hope you will too!",
  "15508": "It's finally finished! My life's work in art. Dare I dream that by accepting this gift, you intend to make it a centrepiece for the world to admire?",
  "15509": "It's my favourite time of the year again - the best craftsmen in town are gathering for the annual artisan fair! Aren't you excited to greet them and contemplate their masterful work?",
  "16374": "Oh, the hardships of the lowly life! I... I don't think I am quite fit for this... Please, take this for the loss of time.",
  "16135": "These two men claim they are the best poets in the city! Please settle their argument, choose the one you prefer.",
  "16133": "Roses are red.<br/><br/>Violets are blue.<br/><br/>Onions stink.<br/><br/>And so do you.",
  "16134": "My head is full of random stuff,<br/><br/>Like rusty bread and bits of fluff.<br/><br/>And talking pies with googly eyes,<br/><br/>And stupid stuff that doesn't rhyme.",
  "15657": "I really hope this final prototype will function correctly outside of a laboratory... Perhaps you'd be willing to put it through its paces?",
  "15658": "These seeds are the product of years of painstaking plant grafting in our botanical nurseries. This crop should now grow on your island as if in its natural climes!",
  "15659": "It is far too common to see the poor suffer ill health, whether from smoking chimneys, or the miasma of the mines! One of my esteemed peers has dedicated their life to curing people of their illnesses. If you have a position available, I'm sure they would work wonders!",
  "15662": "Charles Darwin, one of the greatest minds of the century is in town! He has been conducting studies about evolution but some of his experience subjects have escaped and are running in the city. If you help him I am sure he would agree to work for you. Start with the fishes close to the harbour!",
  "16154": "Great! That's the first animal of his experiment! Could you find his crocodiles now?",
  "16155": "Wonderful! Just need the baboon and we are all set!",
  "16156": "I just spoke to mister Darwin, he is thrilled to work with a patron so understanding as you. He agrees to move in the city!",
  "15660": "All these children, sent to the factories as soon as they learn to walk! Such a pity! A child should have a chance to learn to read and acquire skills! Please, convince some workers parents that this is the best for their child, I am willing to teach them for free.",
  "16157": "Mmh, I can send her my child but there is no way that I am feeding this useless mouth, she will have to take care of it as well! ",
  "16158": "What a wonderful opportunity! I wished I had the same when I was a child.",
  "16159": "Leaning is the best way for my daughter to understand the pressure classes put on us and fight them effectively!",
  "16160": "I do need the money my daughter brings by going to the factory but if this allow her to do better than me in life ...",
  "16161": "Teaching to children? What a weird idea, mine learnt everything she had to know by living the real life! ",
  "16162": "What is she? Some kind of Jean Valjean? Fair enough, let her take care of my son but she better not complain when he will do his usual shenanigans.",
  "15661": "I have been exchanging for months with a man who calls himself El Professor. He is so intelligent, he seems to always know what I am going to say before I even say it! And now he is coming in the city! I promised I would make him visit the bank. Could you pick him up?",
  "16163": "Thank you! He loved the bank, he said he will visit it with friends of his soon!",
  "15664": "People who keep exotic pets, and fail to care for them, seldom realise the damage they do to native animal populations! We must catch the invaders before they have chance to take hold!",
  "15665": "Could you take a photograph of us in front of the University, please? My daughter has studied eleven hours a day, for five solid years to reach this moment!",
  "15666": "Because I'm a woman, many question if the breakthrough really is mine. As such, it gives me the greatest pleasure to be photographed beside the steam shipyard where my new engine will be used.",
  "15667": "The workers assume I'm too fancy to get my hands dirty, but I value field work greatly! A photograph of me visiting the steelworks shall prove it!",
  "15668": "I wonder what would happen if we tried to photograph a train in motion? The exposure will likely make it a blur, or a smudge at best, but why don't we conduct a little test!",
  "15671": "I am hosting an academic symposium for my co-authors, and I need to feed them all. Experts say fish is good for the brain — please, deliver some to my home?",
  "16164": "It seems we have no time to cook the fish, at least in part because we can't reach consensus on the best method. Perhaps you could bring us some of the tinned stuff instead?",
  "15669": "My sand-themed paper cannot present a single unifying theory without the support of experimental evidence! I will need materials!",
  "15670": "With so much still to be discovered, we cannot afford to rest! If recent health research is to be believed, my colleagues and I have little to fear from our coffee indulgences!",
  "15672": "We are presently trying to teach chimps and bonobos to perform human tasks, and would like a fleet of bicycles on which we can wheel them to the park. Would you be able to help?",
  "15673": "Most people still fear the light bulb! They think they'll be electrocuted if they touch one! Well, let's bring them out of the dark ages. Help me organise an eastern festival of light, with an undercurrent of education!",
  "15674": "People of the New World worship me. Hmm...",
  "15786": "Everywhere I go, people seem to look through me. Hmm...",
  "16113": "An imperfect sphere, white with light; I grow in the darkness, the lady's delight. Hmm, what is it?",
  "16114": "Break a piece of me off, and I can provide shade. What am I?",
  "16115": "When they are green, and when they are brown, their bendy mien will cause me to frown. But split in between, for a very short while, they're joyfully yellow and cause me to smile!<br/><br/>What am I?",
  "16116": "I'm fastest on a full belly, and it sounds like I'm going cheap. What am I?",
  "16117": "I stop, it keeps running.<br/>What is it?",
  "15675": "As the holding company, about time you received some additional benefits, eh? Take some surplus product!",
  "15676": "An associate has bailed on me at the crucial moment. Perhaps you want these gramophones, at a fraction of the usual price?",
  "15677": "I brought this back from the last trip, but it really does not befit our mantelshelf as I thought it would. Please, you keep it!",
  "15678": "Productivity— keyword of our time! Use this machine! It will never ask a wage, be indolent, or show up late!",
  "15679": "The exhibition opening has been a ripping success! Cause for celebration— one I should be honoured to sponsor!",
  "15683": "I'm always looking to gain an advantage over the competition! Convince them to back-off, and I predict the markets will pick-up.",
  "16166": "Wood flammable? Hmmn, yes I suppose that is a safety risk, maybe I will invest elsewhere...",
  "16167": "You're right, I am stressed. And a holiday might keep the whole family quiet for a while...",
  "16168": "Involved in shady dealings you say? Then I owe you my thanks, and shall withdraw from the deal immediately!",
  "15684": "I wish to form an investment consortium— and what with so many affluent visitors in the city...any chance you might 'hook us up'?",
  "16169": "Oh no, I'm terribly sorry, we blew all of our family fortune on this holiday...",
  "16170": "With a fellow notorious for his disreputable business practices? Never!",
  "16171": "That sounds a lucrative proposition indeed! I shall accept forthwith!",
  "15685": "Never mind if Christmas is coming, he shall not have a day off! Where is the fool anyway? Made destitute by his thriftless present-giving perhaps?!",
  "16172": "Mr Scrounge may seem miserly, but I am certain a candle of charity burns yet in his heart. I shall wish him greetings of the season as I would any other!",
  "16173": "Bah! Humbug! What reason has he for being so merry?! I am by far the richer, and yet I find that season abhorrent!",
  "15686": "If we are to drag this place out of the mire, we need talent. Talent I say! If only we could prise some quality away from Sir Archibald's offices of state...",
  "16174": "Dashed sorry old chap, but I'm a royalist through and through!",
  "16175": "For some upstart business nonsense? Are you mad? I work for the Queen!",
  "16176": "Yes! I will join you. After all, I have always been royally undervalued here...",
  "15680": "The dratted news boys are delivering yesterday's paper to our subscribers! Quick! Collar them before the Financial Express becomes a laughing stock!",
  "15681": "He was cavorting through the streets in his underwear! Goodness knows how he arrived at such a state of undress, but he must be stopped!",
  "15682": "Poor, gentle Nelson... He can't have gone far! My little kitty loves the member's club - maybe he's there, hoping to catch a few morsels of food?",
  "15689": "Every impecunious old family seems to be courting my riches with offers of marriage. A few snaps will ensure I'll get more than just a title—if you know what I mean...",
  "16177": "A solid, industrious frame, but too ancient! No, this old family factory is a lost cause!",
  "16178": "Ugh! What tired and tumbledown features! I see no prospects here.",
  "16179": "Oh yes, wowzer! I think we've hit the jackpot. That factory looks ideally situated.",
  "15687": "Mister Jenkins is the one, I'm sure of it! I pursued him by foot as far as the public mooring... What business could he have there but to be trading my secrets with mafiosi!?",
  "15688": "All they do is complain about being poor! What of hard work? If I did it from nothing, so can they, a photograph of me can prove it!",
  "15690": "I am smiling for the first time in decades! You must take a photograph! The spirits have shown me the way— oh what a fool I was! I shall give my employee and his family a Christmas to remember!",
  "15691": "A statue of me will galvanize the layabouts of this city into action! Productivity will soar, and so will profits!",
  "15692": "What do you take me for? Think I want to mix with the plebeians in a grotty tavern? No! I want membership of an elite club, and to garner social influence!",
  "15694": "This week has me bored stiff, and I don't have time to work out how to relax. Entertain me! Spoil me with the novel, the exotic, the exquisite!",
  "16180": "Are you quite mad, sirrah? Who doesn't already have a gramophone?!",
  "16181": "I'm the one who needs to blow off steam! I don't need an engine to do it for me!",
  "16182": "Well no surprise in the end, but ever a winner. You know me well! Gold is the one thing I shall never tire of.",
  "15697": "These charity gala are crucial to do business but annoyingly I need to give to charity to attend. Deliver supplies to \"Indigent order\" on my behalf, you would be sweet.",
  "16183": "Fine, they were happy with the delivery. You don't mind me saying I paid for these right?",
  "15693": "Everyone who's anyone will be at this party, Better make sure the horses get their apples— and this is a whole herd of prime mustang we're talking about!",
  "15695": "I'm trying to corner the executive lunch rush with these corn flaps from across the water, but I'm going to need a bally sample batch...",
  "15696": "My darling granddaughter is the only one capable of bringing tears to my eyes. I only hope showering her with gifts will make up for any difficulty I have expressing these feelings.",
  "16123": "Eh, you know what this is? I went for a walk in the mountains and found my paca nibbling on it. Go on, take it, it's not like I need it.",
  "15521": "Young lads will go through their lives without ever knowing a good day of honest labour. Bring me them kids so I can teach them what real work looks like!",
  "15513": "Ha, with those scrawny shoulders he couldn't even lift a sickle!",
  "16096": "Oh... o-ok, I guess... ",
  "16097": "Pfft, who cares!",
  "16098": "Nan.",
  "16099": "Sure ...",
  "15525": "I... I asked my grandson to help me write something for an... old acquaintance from El Puerto. Just... you just hand it over, yes?",
  "16184": "Did she say something? ...No, I don't want to know. I just hope she understands...",
  "15522": "The alpacas are loose, master! No no no, how could this happen!? Help this old man gather his flock back, por favor!",
  "15523": "This weather, boss... I swear I never saw animals behave like this. Los cocodrilos, for example, are getting dangerously close to town. Something must be done before a kid gets hurt...",
  "15524": "Pearl-diving has always been a dangerous job, trust me, I've been doing it since I was a muchacho. But we never had as many problems with the sharks as we do now. Think you can chase them away?",
  "15520": "My nieto, Miguel, said he was going to visit his abuelita for El Día de los Muertos. But boss, my Antonia passed away years ago! And Miguel still hasn't returned...",
  "15526": "Ever since my nieta María fed and sheltered that crook Bill, she keeps mumbling something about a grotto in the pirate island. Hell if I know what you will find there...",
  "21483": "Lama lamaaamasticot lamamasticot! Lama lama masticot lamasticoooot! ",
  "15527": "Well, here we are. Didn't your editor want a picture of us \"busy bees of the New World\"? To think people waste their time with this petty distractions...",
  "15528": "My bones get heavier and heavier with each passing day... I would like to have my picture taken. You know, for the family altar, but... We are very poor, boss. You have a picture machine, sí...?",
  "15529": "When I was a young boy my father took me sailing with him every day. The sea mist, the sails in the wind... I miss it all as much as I miss him.If I had but a picture to bring back all these memories with my pa...",
  "15530": "No wonder our youths have completely forsaken our values when we don't have a church to spread the gospel truth!",
  "15531": "My cousin Pablo lost his home to the flames. They have nowhere to stay... If you could only build a new house for them, our entire familia would be forever grateful, boss.",
  "15532": "Nothing brings us jornaleros as much joy as stroking a sweet guitar. I used to be a luthier back in the day, if you bring me wood, I can make one for everyone.",
  "15533": "My grandkids keep pestering me to play with them. And I'm not the only one, kids here seem to be utterly bored. With some alpaca wool I could make plush toys for them.",
  "15534": "I remember my mamá cooking for the whole neighbourhood, spreading the joy with her homemade fried plantains. I would like to honour her memory by doing the same, if you can spare some plantains and oil.",
  "16075": "There are rumours of a child striving to survive in the wilderness! People say a bear and a panther look after him, but those are no conditions to live in! Could you find him for me? I will take good care of the poor thing.",
  "16076": "A gang of horribly corrupter police officers are extorting the good people of this town and beating people up when they refuse to comply. They have threatened me too, but not speaking up against injustice is against my nature!",
  "16077": "The jornaleros at the corn field, they are so hard-working... Too much for their own good! They need to take their legally required break! They won't listen to us, but I know they'll listen to you.",
  "16078": "Help! My friends has been abducted by La Fortune's brutes! She must be somewhere on his island! Please, I beg of you, bring her back!",
  "16079": "The war has left many orphans behind... I am committed to doing as much good as I can in the world. If you see a child on the streets, will you send them to me? I will look after them.",
  "16080": "Gratitude is so often taken for granted... We have decided to give good where good is due. I know it's a small thing, but we wanted to celebrate everything you've done for us with a present.",
  "16081": "Our family gathers every week to have a lunch together, but and there's always so much food left over! I hate to see it all go to waste. Please, take it and share it with the ones in need.",
  "16082": "The bridge you have set between our continents is unprecedented! I have learned so much from your Old World, I would love to contribute to spread the knowledge about our culture there as well! Could you take this and set it on display?",
  "16083": "Nana Angustias passed away and left me her wedding jewellery set, but I don't need it, really. I know it's worth something, though, so could you put it to use to help the less fortunate? It's what she would have wanted.",
  "16084": "Today marks the first year anniversary of the rise of our revolution. Your editor wants to feature us freedom fighters in a commemorative article, and since you have been such an inspiration for us it would mean a lot if you could take the snapshot.",
  "16085": "We are all so proud of all the exemplary improvements you have done here, as should you! Wouldn't it be perfect to celebrate this town with a feature article in your newspaper? It may encourage more people to emigrate to join us!",
  "16086": "Our society has come such a long way in the past few years! Now a woman can pursue a career in medicine and have her own income and independence without it being frowned upon. My colleagues and I want to set an example for generations to come — could you showcase a picture of us in your newspaper?",
  "16088": "We are lucky enough to be living times of peace, but many of my comrades are still fighting against the grip of La Corona. They require weapons, but it would be too risky for you to smuggle them yourself. If you entrust me with the supplies, I could sent them to my comrades through our underground network!",
  "16089": "Many of our comrades are still fighting against La Corona, but their supplies are running low and hunger is starting to wear them down... If you can spare some food, I can make sure it gets to them.",
  "16090": "Most can't imagine how cold nights can get in the open, even if it's warm in daylight. I will never forget the freezing nights when we were running from La Corona. If you can spare some alpaca wool, I can make blankets to send the refugees.",
  "16091": "It is a real shame that children here have to be home schooled. The experience of sharing knowledge is lost on us. If only we had a museum, we could turn it into a shrine of culture.",
  "16092": "We have fought long and hard to be rid of tyranny, now is the time for democracy! We need to elect our own representatives, and they can only work from a town hall.",
  "16093": "§--16093--§",
  "16094": "Ah, the classics of literature! I abhor the thought of people going about their whole lives without ever reading a page. We need to spark the love for the written word! How about a book exhibition?",
  "16095": "There are still so many war refugees knocking at our doors, Gobernor. If you were to house them, I am sure they would be more than happy to join our flourishing community!",
  "17210": "All this running around your city has left me starving! It sure is beautiful here - but how can I enjoy anything with a rumbling stomach? Ah, if only I could savour the view with a juicy piece of local meat!",
  "17211": "Ahh, that was wonderful! My brain's running a lot better now it's all greased up, if you catch my drift. My name is Dennis Brammen, and I guess you could say I'm a content creation specialist. I know exactly what you need to get your city the likes it deserves. I'll write a cool article for your newspaper - just take a picture of your deliciously plump piggies!",
  "17212": "Now that's what I call a partnership! I like you, buddy. You \"get\" my sophisticated palate - and your place isn't too bad either! I've invited my whole group of friends to come over - they'll love it here! Come on, let's join them at the pub!",
  "17206": "This is the yummiest fish I've ever put in my mouth! But let's face it - fish is barely an appetiser, right? Keep it coming!",
  "17207": "Damn, that wurst was awesome - what an explosion of flavour! Now, I think it's time for the main course. I hear your beef's been praised far and wide for its high quality!",
  "17208": "Darn right, that's the stuff!! So juicy and tender, it melts in the mouth... It just needs a nice, crispy brown toast on the side.",
  "20041": "My great passion is fashioning costumes to help bring the past to life! If only I had real images to work from, my designs could be all the more authentic! Perhaps you could photograph some museum exhibits from the old northern kingdoms, or even our long-lost ancestors from the Bronze Age for me?",
  "20042": "Such unbelievable wonders! I'm so inspired now, I need to design some new clothes! Still, I do feel I'm missing something... A breath of fresh air... Or rather, warm air!",
  "20043": "It's perfect! After studying this picture and your museum meticulously, I have come up with a new design - something I believe has never been done before in the world of fashion. But I need materials from the source... Oh, if you could bring some to me!",
  "20044": "I am so thrilled to have created a piece that brings together the cultures of both the Old and New World! You've helped me so much, I would love to repay you by spreading my expertise among your people!",
  "21694": "Those extinct animals you keep are so majestic — magical even. This giant deer, for instance, is certain to canter across the pages of my new fiction. Still, further research is needed, and I need a place to write the thing! Would you happen to have any suggestions?",
  "21695": "Those are some astonishing animals you have there! I intend to write a story which depends upon real and factual observations of the deep seas — and as such, I enjoy any challenge to my misconception of the creatures that dwell therein. Perhaps you have more maritime curiosities you could share with me?",
  "21696": "The other writers believe it to be fiction, but I am going insane! Something both terrible and terrific lies beneath our feet, in the abyss, trapped in the ice. A cult devoting itself to the same monstrous deity is gathering in the New World — I must be present to document our end! Bring me pictures and artifacts, and build a hospital to care for those plagued by the coming darkness!",

  "16214": "The most curious bond is being blessed at the Church: Montanes and Capitules, lifelong enemies, are now united by the wedding between their first borns. A picture would set the memory fast in their memories, so they never go back to their old quarrels.",

  "16217": "This farmer is working very hard to provide for her family. Having a fountain nearby would really lift a heavy burden from her shoulders.",
  "16218": "Farming tools are dangerous! A few accidents have already stemed from not storing them properly. The farmer would like to have a kiosk to safely put them away.",
  "16219": "This farmer's father refuses to retire despite his old age. She has asked that you plant a tree near the field so he can at least get some rest from the sun.",
  "16220": "This farmer is terribly committed to her craft, and would like to learn more about agriculture on other shores. She has requested that you deliver some plantain from the New World for her and her colleagues to taste.",

We've seen the renaissance, and the age of enlightenment. We've even travelled into the future, settled the ocean floor, and colonized the moon.<br/>",

  "14365": "Princess Qing is a young and uncertain envoy of the Imperial East. Struggling to bring about the very different diplomatic wishes of the Emperor and Empress here in a new and unfamiliar place, she takes consolation in writing wistful poetry on the nature of home.",
  "14366": "Behind the bold swish of Willie's conjuror's cape lives a fragile mouse, desperate for the affection conferred upon him by his late mother. Above all, it is fear that grips him — of some unspeakable and ghoulish reprisal — for Willie seems to have acquired his great fortune suspiciously suddenly!",
  "14367": "George Smith was, long ago, a slave. An explosion in the mine took his father, and rendered George deaf. Finding freedom, George seized the chance to make something of his life, and has now apparently done it all. But don't let that fool you — he's not finished yet.",
  "14368": "Beryl O'Mara was a goodly soul once — back when she believed her meek shopkeeper husband would escape the debtor's prison. He didn't. Years later, it is now her that's running the street game, with the help of her many eyes and ears. She'll invite you in for tea, but don't get too cosy — that's a sawn-off under the floral tablecloth!",
  "14369": "Artur Gasparov is a self-proclaimed visionary, francophile, and pursuer of architectural perfection. Breaking from the mirror only to schmooze with the most important critics, Gasparov has little patience for others, or indeed, any empathy at all. As he himself has said, 'Every great city is ruined by its people.'",
  "14370": "Carl is a repugnant, industrialist fat-cat. Blaming his parents for allowing the once-great name of Von Malching to fade from view, he is ever desperate to rub up with the nobility — and of course, to pile up the gold. His philosophy is \"money equals reputation\", so take, take and take some more!",
  "14371": "Alonso Graves is a man disturbed. A former soldier of the Empire, war transformed his soul forever. The disdain and misanthropy within him can only momentarily be silenced by the blood of his former masters. Believing himself now to be a god, he is intent on 'freeing' all he can from the shackles of human existence.",
  "14372": "Admiral Vicente Silva is an experienced, calculating and humourless conqueror. His noble upbringing, and education at the finest military academies has primed him for a life in power. A staunch traditionalist, his conviction is that the crumbling empire of La Corona - in whose service he profits - will prevail against a world in rebellion.",
  "14373": "Lady Margaret Hunt's influence cannot be overestimated. A member of the Royal Council, she is trusted by all, rarely seeking sympathy for what has unquestionably been a difficult life. After all, she was born a Harlow — a name now synonymous with treason — but then, that was all buried long ago.",
  "14374": "Anne Harlow is the vengeful leader of a forsaken band — the last hurrah of piracy. She was born into nobility, only to see her father Benjamin hung for speaking against the King. In exile, Anne's lust to destroy the crown and social order has only grown with the arrival of a new and vulnerable Queen.",
  "14375": "Jean La Fortune escaped a life of slavery to become the leader of a fledgling nation on the isle his people call High Mountain. But his people cannot hope to grow while the Empire refuses to recognise their independence. With few allies in society, it seems Jean has little choice left but to fight.",
  "18113": "Isabel Sarmento is the passionate leader of a rebellion in the New World which people call \"The Movement\", striving for independence from Old World empires. She lost her brother to the violence, but this only seems to have strengthened her resolve. She knows her people will have to fight clever if they want to build a lasting future for themselves.",
  "18114": "Eli Bleakworth is a deeply resentful servant of the crown, charged with governing Wormways Prison, a depraved and isolated facility. Taking great pleasure in carrying out punishments, he is strict and unbending, believing the scum receive only what they deserve. Suspicious to the core, he will no doubt be keeping his beady eyes on you too!",
  "18115": "To even browse Kahina's emporium can feel like a privilege, so luxurious are her exotic displays. But to Kahina, this whole enterprise is rather humdrum - a compromise for her comfort and safety, and one that seems desperately dull in comparison to the daredevil life of intrigue and prestige that she once led.",
  "20097": "Sir Archibald Blake is the steadfast counsel of Her Majesty the Queen. Optimistic, tactful and yet frequently awkward, good old Archie just wants everyone to get along. Years of diplomatic dinners have cultivated in him a great predilection for small talk, which can lead the unwary into believing he is not as wise as he truly is.",
  "20098": "Old Nate is a drifter, opportunist and inventor. His life's work is his airship and the island on which it is moored, each a hodgepodge of parts he has obtained over the years, by means unknown. Occasionally, he tolerates crossing paths with others - so long as they're ready to do their bit, and split the spoils down the middle.",

  "800158": "<b>A helpless merchant brig is being pillaged by despicable pirates.</b> Its captain is a friend to many of your crew, who are ready to die in order to save him. The pirates answer to Calico Roberts - the last terrible pirate - but the light is dim, and they have not noticed your ship.",
  "800159": "Ask the advice of your former pirate",
  "800163": "<b>'I knew this would come in handy someday,'</b> the old cove mutters, as he unravels the flag of Calico Roberts. 'They wouldn't dare tear their master's cloth!' As your ship steers into view with the new flag, the pirates do nothing. They fully believe you serve the same master! Your guns fire and surrender is quick. The merchants are grateful and offer considerable compensation!",
  "800160": "Fire cannons at the pirates' ship",
  "800164": "<b>Success comes quickly.</b> Volley after volley of ordnance so cleanly perforates the pirate hull, it is turned into alpine cheese. The surprised pirates are suddenly waving the white flag, and the skirmish is won. The merchants are thankful to see their goods returned and offer a fitting reward.",
  "800166": "<b>The attack is an abysmal failure.</b> Almost every cannon shoots wayward, giving the pirates ample time to prepare their own onslaught. They laugh and cheer, and shout awful things as your tattered ship is forced to flee in shame.",
  "800161": "Try to board the pirates' ship",
  "800165": "<b>It's a good fight in which the crew hold their nerve.</b> At first range-finding proves difficult, alerting the pirates to ready their own guns. But after a few exchanges it is clear who is better-equipped, and the pirates raise the white flag. Although some of the men sustain injuries, the merchants are able to offer financial recompense.",
  "800167": "<b>The courageous crew triumph,</b> rushing aboard quickly enough for it to be a surprise, before blowing half the pirates to dust with their blunderbusses. The remaining pirates drop their weapons, and the merchants are able to come out of hiding. 'A great reward is in order', they say, giving you a generous portion of the recovered loot.",
  "800168": "<b>Victory comes at a cost.</b> Luck often plays a part in deck skirmishes, and your crew, unable to surprise the wary pirates, must take many casualties before asserting dominance. The merchants are indebted, and reward your rash heroism appropriately.",
  "800169": "<b>Boarding the ship is a grave mistake.</b> The pirates are too quick and already have the initiative. The men are forced to retreat, kicking the boarding plank away. [AssetData([ExpeditionEventRequirement]) Text] and the others are condemned to a no-doubt gruesome fate.",
  "800162": "Avoid the trouble spot entirely",
  "800170": "<b>'We're bloomin' cowards!' cries a furious sailor,</b> as your ship whisks about, and sails briskly from danger. With the merchant ship left to the dogs, the crew fume at such a display of weakness at their friend's time of need.",
  "801025": "Dockyard Dupe",
  "801026": "<b>Robbed!</b> Having thanked the generous innkeeper, your ship departed what seemed a most hospitable port. Even at the time, your crew were surprised to see so many smiling faces gather at the dock to wave you off. A mere hour into the onward journey, however, it's discovered that a great deal of valuable property is missing from the hold. You must now decide if it's worth going back for.",
  "801027": "Have your detective investigate",
  "801032": "<b>The detective already knows the culprit.</b> \"I was waiting to see if our crew were complicit, but I am satisfied they are not.\" Your ship returns and lays out a watertight case to the local authorities, incriminating the local innkeeper. He is arrested, your equipment is returned and your ship receives a resupply. It seems that hospitality was genuine after all!",
  "801028": "Return and plunder the Harbour",
  "801033": "<b>Swift justice.</b> The petty harbour defences crumble in the morning light. Your ship streaks unopposed into what remains of the smouldering harbour, and turns its guns upon the harbourmaster's office. \"Please, take anything!\" he yelps, \"You'll find all your things in the warehouse, and more besides.\" You profit from a scheme that has been running for years.",
  "801034": "<b>Your assault is too slow.</b> Just as you begin to gain the upper hand over the defenders, the cavalry appear. Cannons pop from the west; a slew of artillery reinforcements. ",
  "801035": "<b>An absolute shambles.</b> Your men couldn't even best a few locals with a primitive demi-cannon. \"Who shall have our guts for garters next?\" yelp those who survive the barrage, \"A small gang of angry turtles?\" Your ship sails hurriedly away.",
  "801036": "Fight them all",
  "801037": "<b>You put an end to the corruption!</b> Brought to their knees, the local authorities admit a conspiracy in which all were complicit. \"It was never meant to go this far. We vow our people shall never rob innocent travellers again!\" Proud to have effected change, you take back your possessions and leave.",
  "801038": "<b>The enemy force is vast.</b> \"There's too many, Captain! We must turn back!\" But it is too late. The western cliff lights up with cannon fire, and your ship follows suit. Many lives will be lost before you finally crawl out of range.   ",
  "801039": "Make peace, and reason with the officials",
  "801040": "<b>Despite your earlier aggression, they are willing to listen.</b> After an exasperating few days, you are finally able to prove your losses. The authorities take in any dockers who are found to be guilty, and most, if not all of your possessions are returned.  ",
  "801041": "<b>The authorities stand with their own.</b> Following a ceasefire, you make your case as best you can, but it's not enough. Furthermore, you must answer for the damage you've caused. Unfortunately, this will mean leaving some of your best sailors behind to help with repairs. ",
  "801029": "Return to the inn in disguise and bait the robbers",
  "801042": "<b>You rumble the schemers!</b> The crew set aside superstition, and paint the ship with a different name. The most cut-throat of your sailors pose as wealthy officers, cabin curtains for sashes, so as to appear perfect victims. Taken in by it all, the innkeeper and his dockside associates are caught in the act. You make sure to relieve them of far more than they stole.",
  "801043": "<b>The disguises are unconvincing.</b> A lick of paint, and the ship differs enough to blend in at the busy port, but moustaches and a change of clothes aren't enough for the sly innkeeper. \"Thought you could fool us?\" he scoffs.",
  "801044": "<b>Your disguises are comically poor</b>, and yet the innkeeper is the picture of cordiality as he ushers your men to retake their seats. Your men exchange hopeful looks, but the other patrons start laughing. Almost in unison, they draw their pistols. \"What were we thinking?\" mutter your men. \"I wonder where you'll end up!\" the innkeeper cackles, as he has your crew stripped, bound, and pushed off to sea.",
  "801045": "Take back what is yours by force",
  "801047": "<b>Sometimes a fistfight is the only way.</b> The inn is a hurricane of chairs and glass, as your crew express themselves the only way they know how. Once the locals are subdued, the innkeeper is dragged outside, his life used as a security against whatever plunder you please. ",
  "801048": "<b>The locals are brutal.</b> Home-made knuckles, knives and cudgels scrape open the faces of your crew. Some are left to bleed out on the sticky hostelry floor, while the bloody remainder are packed off by the authorities for disturbance of the peace. Eventually they will be released, leaving you lighter on both goods and personnel. ",
  "801046": "Threaten to expose their scheme",
  "801049": "<b>The innkeeper agrees to negotiate.</b> \"We've got a good thing going here, and I don't want you spoiling it,\" he sniffs, \"take what's yours and leave.\" Glad to avoid further trouble, your crew recover their possessions and leave. One can but feel sorry for the next poor victims of this villainous scheme.  ",
  "801050": "<b>\"Get out, before we scratch you out!\"</b> growls the innkeeper, his true colours plain to see. It seems every surly thug in the port is on his side. The expedition must take this loss of time and equipment on the chin. ",
  "801030": "Appeal to the local authorities",
  "801051": "<b>You make the case well.</b> \"You are quite right. Terrible corruption such as this must be put to an end!\" says the governor, \"And of course, you shall have back what was taken.\" His disingenuousness stinks to high heaven, but you don't have time to go digging any deeper.",
  "801052": "<b>They are completely corrupt.</b> \"What an extraordinary tale! I am so glad our little country has fired your imagination!\" smiles the governor.",
  "801053": "Risk implicating the governor",
  "801055": "<b>\"Clever. Very clever,\"</b> admits the medal-draped governor, as he puffs solemnly on his cigar. \"How did you know the innkeeper was my brother?\" Your emissary doesn't let slip it was pure guesswork. \"Go ahead, take whatever you want,\" he gestures to a warehouse bursting with confiscated goods, \"so long as you keep quiet about all this— can't have my superiors finding out.\" ",
  "801056": "<b>\"A grave last mistake,\"</b> chuckles the governor, as the poplar-lined grounds of his palace swarm with militia, \"arrest these fops!\" Your delegation try to resist, but are armed only with the toothpicks that came with their canapes. Your expedition must now manage without them.",
  "801054": "Resort to violence",
  "801057": "<b>\"Alright, alright!\"</b> says the amused governor, bayonet to his neck, \"take back what you lost. But then you leave.\" Since the harbour is now so well-guarded, it feels rather an achievement to have forced any sort of compromise. ",
  "801058": "<b>'That was a mistake,'</b> chuckles the governor, as his poplar-lined palace swarms with militia, 'arrest them!' Your crew would rather die than be locked-up for life, so they fight their way out. At least, one or two of them do.",
  "801059": "Give up and leave",
  "801060": "<b>There's widespread frustration among the crew.</b> \"Those instruments were vital for my research!\", \"You let the beggars off scot free?!\", \"This expedition is an embarrassment!\" It's hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.",
  "801031": "Take the loss on the chin",
  "801061": "<b>There's widespread frustration among the crew.</b> \"Those instruments were vital for my research!\", \"You let the beggars off scot free?!\", \"This expedition is an embarrassment!\" It's hard to argue with their assessment, and bad for morale.",
  "801620": "Iceberg",
  "801621": "<b>Your ship is stranded on an iceberg!</b> It is night. The meek light of your vessel seems to dissolve into the moonless blackness. Even at easy sail and under constant vigil, your ship is running the risk in these waters, for slumbering ice giants lurk in the darkness in all directions. \"Dead ahead!\" comes the cry, but it's too late. A low growl shakes the boat, as a wave dumps it atop an iceberg, which is shaped like an upturned molar. The ship is undamaged, but beached — if only it could be returned to the water...",
  "801622": "Break free with dynamite",
  "801626": "<b>Nothing in nature can prevail against human endeavour,</b> it would seem. The crew watch with trepidation as the fuses burn down to the stick, before an ear-splitting series of detonations ring across the vastness, sundering the icy claws that had held your ship hostage. A small blizzard of debris blankets the deck, to the hilarity of all on board, for they are free once more!",
  "801623": "Bombard the icy prison",
  "801627": "<b>Ice crumbles all around courtesy of some impressive firepower.</b> Any cannon that can be swiveled at the target is put to use, chipping away at the icy dungeon in which the ship has become wedged until the way is clear. Then, like a cheerful sea lion, the fair vessel slips down an escarpment and plops back into the water. The crew cheer.",
  "801628": "<b>The iceberg fights back.</b> Though the way is almost clear, the relentless cannon fire seems to have woken the ogre below — and to the horror of the crew, the vast berg rolls slightly to one side. Great shards of ice detach and bounce over the deck, injuring your men. Quick action is needed.",
  "801629": "Get out and push the ship free",
  "801631": "<b>Your men live for such challenges,</b> and scarcely need telling what to do. Leaping down from the boat, they get behind her, knotting guy ropes as fast as they can. As they work, the berg rumbles suggestively, but it is your quick-thinking crew who prevail. Once clear of the ice field, the crew will be able to treat their wounds.",
  "801632": "<b>It's an uphill struggle.</b> The pitching of the unstable berg does not help one jot, as the men tumble and slide to find grip. Such is the effort required to pull the ship successfully down from the iceberg into the sea, that no-one notices one of the teams is missing. It appears they have fallen through a thin part of the ice to their deaths...",
  "801630": "Let the rolling iceberg toss you into the sea",
  "801633": "<b>Your ship performs a rather messy dismount.</b> After that initial roll, the iceberg halts long enough to suggest it wants to stay in its new position — but then everything happens all at once. The berg spins violently, and the ship goes with it! The ship strikes the water at such an angle that very serious damage is done to much of the lee-side. Fortunately, the crew emerge unharmed.",
  "801624": "Build something to help you escape",
  "801634": "<b>The crew assemble a dozen hardy levers to free the ship.</b> Flexible hickory planking is cut and reshaped into wedges, before being inserted into the ice at intervals of five paces, until they surround the stern. On a count of three the men lift, and to their surprise, so does the hull! Once it starts moving, there's no stopping it, and it clatters through the icy obstructions to the sea. Your sailors embrace in the wake of their success — they have been very resourceful.  ",
  "801635": "<b>The crew choose the wrong wood for the task.</b> They select a decorative mahogany veneer, stripped from the captain's cabin. \"Whatever it takes,\" the captain says with laudable magnanimity, but the whole business is futile. Despite the wedges being placed in great number at the stern of the ship, no amount of pressure from the crew can encourage the ship to move, since the levers lack the requisite spring. They'll need to find another way off this iceberg. ",
  "801625": "Pray for divine intervention",
  "801636": "<b>The crew realise they are blessed!</b> \"If God has seen fit to place us here, we should trust in him,\" says the ship's holy man, thoughtfully, \"I would not discount the idea that this very iceberg has sentience! I know of at least one explorer whose expeditions ride bergs by design!\" Indeed, the navigators observe that the iceberg is itself moving, and at fair speed, in a desirable direction. This shall make a fine home for a time.",
  "801637": "<b>The days melt into weeks that melt into months.</b> Even the probable agnostics among the crew take to prayer, for each passing day there is some fresh cause for optimism, some sign that someone is listening. As spring approaches, some of the berg thaws. One day, a migratory bird is spotted. At long, long last, a vast chunk of the iceberg separates, leaving the ship mere metres from open water. A day of heaving has it afloat again, though your men have lost all notion of time.",
  "801638": "<b>There is no-one out there.</b> After a week perched atop the pink-white berg, with supplies diminishing, the crew cannot bear to wait in the gnawing cold any longer. Any help will have to come from within.",
  "802094": "Sea of Sargassum",
  "802095": "<b>A ship in need of rescue!</b> The vast floating tapestries of algae in these windless waters have long been thought impassable. Just when you thought your own vessel had managed to avoid the yellow-orange plants, you see another ship stuck fast! They must also have seen you, as their alarm begins to sound. With no proper rescue equipment aboard, your own ship risks becoming entangled if you get too close. Should you try to help?",
  "802096": "A steamship should have nothing to fear here",
  "802099": "Your steamer glides effortlessly through. The crew lean from the rails to peer at the sargassum colony, which is thick with sealife like crabs and tropical fish. The algae parts easily before your ship. The absence of wind presents no difficulty as it would for a sailboat, and indeed, as you tug them into open water, the crew of the ship in distress explain it was not the algae, but the calm that had stalled them. They are delighted to have been discovered, and several of them offer to join your expedition.",
  "802097": "Harpoon them and tug them away",
  "802100": "<b>A good shot, but there is too little wind to tug them clear.</b> Having signalled your intention, the gunner sends the harpoon crunching into the other ship's hull. A fine shot, considering it was at the limit of the harpoon's range. However, the calm prohibits them pulling the ship out of the brown mass of algae, so the crew consider their next steps. ",
  "802102": "Throw them a 'life-line'",
  "802104": "<b>The breeches buoy guarantees a safe rescue.</b> The crew transform a lifebuoy into a harness, and attach it to runners which allow it to zip between the two ships once the harpoon rope is drawn taut. The stranded sailors take it in turns to enjoy this rather daring form of escape. Having been lifted from the doldrums, they are keen to assist however they may for the remainder of the expedition.",
  "802105": "<b>The breeches buoy shears off into the water</b> just as the first sailor climbs onto the contraption, leaving it dangling perilously from the rope between the two ships. Desperate for rescue, the crew of the stranded boat decide to swim for it instead. After thrashing the distance, the mariners eventually slop aboard, their bodies jaundiced with algae. \"Five years we've been stuck here,\" one stammers angrily. They're going to be quite a burden on your expedition.",
  "802103": "Inspire them to traverse the rope",
  "802106": " <b>A surge of belief animates the stranded sailors.</b> \"You are saved!\" cries your lookout, \"your ordeal is over!\" Under the encouragement of your lieutenants, the other crew grab the rope, and with the desperate strength of hope, they cross the distance to reach your ship. Your crew's goodwill has shone through, and the grateful survivors join your expedition without a second thought.",
  "802107": "<b>They take no strength from your crew's silent prayer.</b> If only someone had offered a few more words of encouragement — anything positive at all. First to cross is an old man so thin, you could fold him up and tuck him in a drawer. Clutching the fibrous rope is challenge enough for his frail wrists, and after a brief struggle, he drops off. His crewmates jump in with him, and commence a desperate thrash through the brown sargassum. The few that make it to your ship will only be a burden on your expedition.",
  "802101": "<b>Panicked sailors toss themselves into the algae,</b> as your stray harpoon crashes wildly through the lower deck, and seawater rushes in through the breach. She's going down! \"We brought them to this,\" yells one of your officers, \"we have a responsibility to do something!\"",
  "802108": "Send your best swimmers to the rescue",
  "802110": "<b>Your swimmers are strong and fit enough,</b> but the malnourished crew of the sinking ship need all the help they can get. The algae weighs like a lion's mane on your heroes, as they relay the castaways on-by-one. Once all are accounted for, they lie on the burning deck, panting. This whole episode has been exhausting.",
  "802111": "<b>The rescue is a tragedy.</b> Your men paddle like puppies in the densely-packed sargassum — it's hard to understand quite how sailors could be so lacking in practice. Gasping, they reach desperately towards the castaways they should be rescuing, as if for support, only for the undertow of the sinking ship to pull them under. This was all your fault.",
  "802109": "Leave them to their fate",
  "802112": "<b>\"We did what we could...\"</b> the lieutenant trails off, \"...and we couldn't do much!\" answers your steersman darkly. There is so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the sinking boat by. Hands reach desperately towards you, but the pull of their sinking ship soon drags them under the surface. It will take an awful lot to lift your crew out of the doldrums.",
  "802098": "Don't risk it",
  "802113": "<b>\"Don't leave! We've been here for ten years!\"</b> Reads the message in semaphore. There's so little wind here, it takes an eternity to pass the stranded boat by. A drift of shame. Your crew, as yellow-bellied as this sea of sargassum, will need a lot to lift them out of the doldrums.",
  "802745": "Jolly Roger",
  "802746": "<b>Pirates!</b> The torn black flag bearing a skull and crossbones is a shock to those on your expedition who thought they were a dying breed. The weather-worn ship emerges from the mist with prepared to plunder. Astride her bow stands her colourful captain, axe raised; along her rails, the spectral silhouette of her starving crew, hungry to feed.",
  "802747": "Manoeuvre into attack position",
  "802749": "<b>You swivel on a sixpence, ready to blow them away!</b> Quickly setting sails to curb momentum, your ship turns in the shallowest possible arc for a vessel this size — a manoeuvre only a tactician well-accustomed to risk would attempt. Meanwhile, some of the crew have improvised a few grenades, should you want to make use of them...",
  "802751": "Fire the cannons!",
  "802753": "<b>The pirates are sunk</b> before they have chance to do any damage at all! Your ship's guns target the most mould-ridden flank of the corsairs' ship, smashing it through. The antique vessel collapses in on itself, and your sailors enjoy the resulting plunder almost as if they themselves had been the pesky picaroons.",
  "802754": "<b>It's a disappointing salvo.</b> Despite being in a strong position, your cannons are miscalibrated, and end up firing short. The pirates know they cannot win this with their outmoded gunnery, and between shots they draw in close, latching onto your ship with their boarding hooks. ",
  "802755": "Defend against the boarding pirates",
  "802757": "<b>Today is not the day you are vanquished by pirates.</b> The rowdy band charge aboard only to find your resolute crew arranged in a classical shield wall, with percussion cap pistols poking out of what few gaps remain. Although your crew sustain fairly gruesome injuries from pirate axes, all but one survive. That young lad is given a funeral, unlike the poor dead pirates.",
  "802758": "<b>You're lucky they don't leave with your ship!</b> Some of your sailors are equipped with old flintlocks, whose inaccuracy permits the enemy to engage at close quarters. The swordplay proceeds so terribly on your side that a section of pirates are able to reach the lower deck, and pilfer all they find. Satisfied, their captain bays \"fall back!\" and the scourge are gone, leaving your crew to count the dead.",
  "802756": "Surrender to them",
  "802759": "<b>\"Take all you want, but please, don't hurt us!\"</b> your officer pleads. The pirate captain grins, revealing a jumbled set of shark teeth, before proceeding to strip the chap of his ear. \"Sounds fair,\" he says, still smiling. Your ship is then relieved of its supplies without further violence; the pirates no doubt bound by some arcane code to honour your surrender. You wonder if your expedition can survive on what the little they leave behind.",
  "802752": "Bombard them with handmade grenades!",
  "802760": "<b>The pirates weren't expecting such a crafty attack.</b> \"I was saving these for a special occasion,\" your weaponsmith burps. The 'special brew' he's concocted consists of a bottle filled with powder, a hemp fuse, and a nail surprise. There's a shimmering sound as they explode, and when the smoke clears, your crew frisk the punctured bodies littering the deck, singing \"Rollicking band of pirates, we!\"",
  "802761": "<b>Ineffective to say the least.</b> The improvised grenades are duff fireworks, and when landing on the pirate deck, they fail to discharge. There is no time to apportion blame, for the tide of battle has swung again in favour of the pirates, who have hooked the two ships together for boarding.",
  "802750": "<b>The turn is not sharp enough.</b> There was nothing wrong with the idea, but whatever tactical advantage your ship may have had is lost with the rather cautious turning circle it plots, out of which the ship emerges a slow-moving target. ",
  "802762": "Position for attack anyway",
  "802764": "<b>You make the best of a poor position.</b> At the last moment, your maverick navigators cut inside the approaching pirates, who had been hoping to board you. Your crew have the breathing space now to act!",

A piece of bright red felt caught in the spring explains all. 'Klabautermann!' they despair, for it is a terrible omen to offend a sea goblin as they have done.",
  "800552": "<b>The crew don't have much belief,</b> and the priest makes a hash of the exorcism. If anything, his fragmented delivery only agitates the creature. The next night, a sailor is adamant he has sighted something 'irrefutably demonic.'",

  "800571": "<b>The ramshackle trap box is in bits the next morning.</b> While to some they appear benign, the claw marks appear more frequently. Once a man wakes with his cheeks gouged. Some are so perturbed by the night demon, that they slink off the ship at the next available harbour.",

Then a commotion... and screaming, followed by silence. Just like that, the fiend has gone forever, returning to the air whence it came. Three men lie dead in their own blood. Their livers have been removed.",

  "800618": "<b>Adaptation is good when a fight isn't going well.</b> The bear flinches but does not drop after the first round of gunfire. There is no time to reload, before it is upon them with its paws. Knocked down the men are smart enough to play dead. After an hour or so facing the floor, the bears lose interest and leave. The crew are able to lick their wounds, and move on.",

'That is why she killed him,' says the brother, gone all vitriol. 'Let us leave, and hope my brother's spirit may somehow live on in this place.'",
  "800635": "<b>The hot-headed hunt is a success none celebrate.</b> Once found, the bear no longer has strength to defend itself. As the brother drives a stake into its heart, it gives over with a last sad sigh. In that moment a tiny cub pads into the open, crawling weakly under the limp arm of its mother. If only they had understood, the crew could have saved the heartache.",

  "802309": "<b>The monstrosity detaches violently!</b> Your men hack fiercely and without relent at a key tentacle until it severs. The loopeyed beast blubbers a pained raspberry, coating the deck with plankton-infused clamminess, before tearing itself back into the sea, with a large section of your ship in tow! Some repairs will be needed!",
  "802310": "<b>There are just too many legs!</b> Having been interrupted at dinner, your sailors try to improvise a dissection with their knives and forks, but the monstrosity refuses to become calamari. Its innumerable tendrils cavort, punching holes and tossing sailors at whim! One unfortunate sailor is flung so perfectly that his return trajectory lands him directly, and fatally, atop a flagpole.

There are familiar sounding terms such as \"gonne\" and \"gun\", for example, although the words for water, tree and mountain are consistent with local dialects. Their mythology appears to centre around a tall, blue-eyed ancestor, who came long ago from the Old World, and eloped up this mountain with a local woman in order to conceive the eagles who now circle its peak. Your party receive the stories with great interest, and are made to feel very welcome.",

  "802577": "<b>Your crew find no guarantee of safe crossing.</b> The sailors quickly get tired of the senseless search: the river's depth cannot be appraised by their untrained eyes, and each segment of the water seems both deep and shallow at once. The crew are too reluctant to try their luck, and abandon their search, disgruntled.",
  "802575": "Create a raft to cross the river",
  "802599": "<b>A safe passage!</b> The raft is basic but sturdy, and it crosses the river without losing so much as a plank. The crew board the opposite bank safely, and climb the hill that rises beyond it. On the other side, they happen upon a vast enclosed field: a pen for horse breeding. A quick discussion with the owner confirms that the thieves stole several animals mere hours ago. The land beyond is barren and unfit for explorers on foot. Your crew need horses.",
  "802600": "<b>The raft can't even float.</b> Your sailors bind logs and dead branches together with sturdy knots, but with little actual knowledge of how to assemble a raft. The raft's apparent stability tricks the builders into climbing on to it, and it swirls over the river, wobbling under the weight of sailors and the pressure of the current, before breaking and diving straight into the icy waters below. Few sailors can be rescued from the wreckage.",
  "802573": "<b>No tracks are found.</b> The bustling harbour and the late evening conspire to hide the thieves' tracks. Your sailors aren't skilled enough to pick up the faint trail inside the town itself, but they might have better luck around the outskirts.",
  "802601": "Keep searching",
  "802603": "<b>Finally, tracks to follow!</b> Amidst the numerous footprints left by your sailors, your best huntsmen manage to find the dotted lines left in the dust by the fleeing thieves. There's no mistaking the bent pattern of their limping leader. The prints waddle to the nearest river, where they fade into the water.",

'He wants putting out of his misery,' a sailor cries, once the man is wrestled to the deck again. So they cut his throat. Attention turns to the doctor, but he is a doctor no more. Injury has rendered him insensible; an eight-year-old boy trapped in the body of a man!",

  "800680": "<b>What dreary decor!'</b> says the Lieutenant tartly. Matters deteriorate when some ill-fashioned bunks collapse. 'I'd rather have the itching back,' says an exhausted-looking sailor.

  "800678": "Simply change the sheets",
  "800681": "<b>It is a job half-done.</b> For most the problem goes away, but some must live with the itching. Wherever the bugs' nasty little hidey-hole is, it must still reel with lousy punters, each telling stories of the sailor blood they drained the night before.",

  "800682": "<b>The priest's most divine bottle does the trick.</b> 'This water is indeed holy!' he says, as the fearsome muscovite vodka from 1791 is uncorked and slapped over the itches of the queuing sailors. 'Shame to use it like this, but I'd rather sleep,' he cackles.",
  "800683": "<b>'Is nothing sacred anymore?'</b> Says the priest, who turns up his nose at the suggestion of using his water for something so humdrum. 'The lord hath bigger fish to fry,' he says pointedly. As well as the vile and incessant itching, the crew now have a parsimonious priest to contend with.",
  "800672": "<b>The doctor is a demented quack.</b> When the condition is established correctly as crusted scabies - contagious, but hardly dangerous - the doctor's experiment is for the affected to bathe in an acid solution.

  "800684": "<b>Sand and sun is a panacea!</b> An acute sense of direction leads the ship to an island paradise. A freshwater lagoon relieves the itching, and the much-needed relaxation will stand all in good stead for the journey ahead.",
  "800685": "<b>Bringing contagion to port might be a bad idea.</b> The itching is at its worst by the time the expedition reaches the bustling alien seaport, something the local authorities don't fail to notice. The harbour-master's tug escorts you to quarantine. How do you escape?",
  "800687": "Lie that the sickness isn't contagious",
  "800690": "<b>The lie works like a charm.</b> A doctor promptly comes aboard to confirm this hypothesis. Although she sternly points out the condition is contagious after all, she also recognises it to be a mild complaint. 'Crabs,' the translator says, face flushing. The crew are too relieved to feel embarrassed.",

As your ship crashes wildly out between jetties, the escort ship pincers, and opens fire. The effect is catastrophic. Your modest vessel flees in tatters, and many good sailors are dead or wounded. For the rest, the itching is set to continue.",

  "800695": "<b>It's a long time before the authorities deal with you,</b> with bureaucracy seemingly a way of life here. When you finally have access to a medical professional, there is already a post-mortem to be conducted. It appears chemicals leeched into the water supply and caused the rashes and sickness. With the water changed, the others recover, but it cannot redeem the loss of a life.",
  "800686": "<b>It's impossible for your aimless navigators to concentrate.</b> The expedition fidgets wildly off course, with no land in sight.

  "800882": "<b>The doctor concocts a panacea</b>, which not only purges the belly-dwelling roundworm, but more besides. Garlic, wormwood, and lemon quietly see off a myriad other complaints of your spoon-dodging sailors.",
  "800883": "<b>The doctors disagree.</b> 'Madam! Bloodletting gives our patients only a fifty-fifty chance!' says one. 'Sir, tinctures are seldom beneficial OR effective on parasites!' says the other.",

  "800887": "Risk bloodletting the patients",
  "800888": "Let nature take its course",
  "800889": "<b>A fine placebo.</b> As if by magic, the intestinal worms lose the will to go on. The doctor freely admits this is more likely down to positive patient attitude, than his revolting tincture.",
  "800890": "<b>The unpleasant medicine doesn't help.</b> Constant trips to the privy are now the only release for your bug-ridden crew. The doctor admits to the failure of the tincture, but thankfully has something for diarrhoea.",
  "800891": "The tincture is poison! Having seen their first shipmate choke on his dose, the rest decide they'd rather live with a six-foot tapeworm in their bellies.",
  "800892": "<b>Somehow it works</b>, and the patients are rid of the parasite. The doctor seems unsurprised, 'human physiology may be complex, but treatment need not be.' A pretty vague case summary, but who cares?!",
  "800893": "<b>Perfect preparation for amputation!</b> At least that's what your crazed doctor would have you believe. Once her macabre experiment is concluded there is surely only one course of action for the afflicted...the crew are aghast.",

  "802083": "The Broken Mast",
  "802084": "<b>Sailor under the mast!</b> Weeks of harsh weather have taken their toll on the ship, and the violent gusts of wind this morning have toppled the mizzenmast. For a moment, the ropes tying it to the other masts hold it in place, but there's only so much weight they can take: they break with a snap, letting the mizzenmast plummet on the deck. A sailor now wails, his leg caught under a pole twice his size.",
  "802085": "Cover the leg with a mix of soap and water, and pull it away",
  "802088": "<b>The sailor is easily pulled from under the mast.</b> The foamy water allows the crushed leg to slither away from the debris, and the limb emerges covered in rainbow bubbles and bloody splinters. The man will live - and maybe, with a miracle or two, his leg will mend.",
  "802086": "Cut the leg with a bone saw",
  "802089": "<b>An extreme but commendable choice.</b> The sailor is given rum to drink and a cloth to bite before he is held in place, and his leg bound with a tight tourniquet. The doctor's labour is gruesome, and the man can feel the grinding cuts as they tear through him, and he screams through the cloth as he howls and he roars - and yet the doctor stays composed and focused. When the leg is finally cut and the sailor dragged away, the crew feels reassured that they are in capable hands.",
  "802090": "<b>Butchery.</b> The doctor's hands tremble more than his victim does, and the saw draws zigzags through his patient's flesh, each cut unable to connect with the previous ones. The trapped sailor's screams become whimpers, then silence. The doctor has to be stopped before he can ruin any more of the unfortunate corpse, and his blood-clad figure sends a warning to whoever might need his help in future.",
  "802087": "Lift the mast with a makeshift lever",
  "802091": "<b>The man is freed.</b> Using one of the partners broken by the mast, the crew fits sturdy pieces of timber between the deck and the fallen mast, adding plank after plank in the opening, before gradually raising the mast with ropes and pulleys tied to the mainmast. They manage to lift the mast long enough to free the sailor, and the doctor immediately tends to his crushed leg.",
  "802092": "<b>The vague idea of a lever never becomes real.</b> The sailors try to lift the mizzenmast by rolling logs underneath, but the huge wooden pole is far too heavy for its rolling movements to be controlled. The mast lurches forward and rolls from the sailor's leg to his chest, pushing his insides out. The view stays with the sailors for days before they can finally reach a decent harbour, get rid of the broken mast, and clean up the grisly mess underneath.",
  "802710": "Message In A Bottle",
  "802711": "<b>Castaways request your help, but where could they be?</b> Shark-baiting is a common distraction for your sailors, but their latest catch provided much more entertainment than expected. In its belly was a bottle, and in the bottle were three sheets of paper, each a copy of the same message in different languages. Piecing together the documents to make up for their weathered content, the crew can make out a call for help and a latitude, but nothing more.",
  "802712": "Examine the entrails of the shark for clues",
  "802715": "<b>The stomach of the shark reveals its travels.</b> Glittering corals, exotic scales, and characteristic fish bones - your doctors finish their inspection of the shark's entrails and confirm your destination: to the Southern coral barriers! When the ship reaches the correct latitude, several islands litter the horizon. The crew hesitates to come any closer. The water is shallower than usual, and filled with sharp coral reefs.",
  "802718": "Navigate closer to the islands and their reefs",
  "802720": "<b>Your ship avoids the deadly reefs and finds the castaways!</b> The vessel groans as it swims through the clear waters, the deepest corals reflecting its shadow as it narrowly avoids them. It takes a short while to find the castaways, entrenched among the dunes of a secluded beach, sprouting from it with squeals of joy and disbelief. Their captain offers his unalienable loyalty, and your crew gladly welcomes the newcomers.",
  "802721": "<b>The ship cannot pass the underwater barrier.</b> Despite your navigator's efforts, the ship bumps against the coral reef - the manoeuvre is too complex and too risky for her. The crew are forced to turn their backs on the paradisiacal islands. Whether the castaways were real, and whether they were indeed stranded here, they will never know.",
  "802719": "Stay away and have the look-out search for castaways",
  "802722": "<b>Found them!</b> Your look-out shows their brilliance when they spot the thin smoke line of a campfire in the distance. A dinghy is sent to retrieve the castaways, and comes back filled to the brim with men with overgrown beards, torn clothes, and awed expressions. Their captain pledges himself to your crew. Once shaved and washed, the castaways prove themselves to be excellent sailors - and even better companions.",
  "802723": "<b>The look-out draws a blank.</b> Scanning the islands from afar is a difficult exercise, made even harder by the lack of experience. The crew soon realises that it will never find anyone from such a distance. Reluctant to risk the ship's integrity over the mere possibility of the castaways' existence, your sailors choose to leave and forget.",
  "802724": "<b>The homemade autopsy is a mess.</b> The shark's entrails are cut along with their contents, and spilled over the deck is a nauseous mass of gore and artefacts of unknown origin. The doctor cannot make sense of the anarchy he's created.",
  "802725": "Interpret the patterns in the shark's entrails",
  "802727": "<b>Relentless faith guides the most deserving.</b> In the spilled guts of the shark, your navigators see the shapes of islands, your doctors see the patterns of life forms, and your boatswain sees the promise of rewards. Driven by an inner force beyond simple greed, the crew sails past coral reefs and insidious currents, and finds the island on which the castaways had been waiting for rescue. Their relief is glorious, and their captain promises to serve your crew!",
  "802728": "<b>There is nothing to find but deceit.</b> Your cooper burns some sage among the remains of the shark, and sniffs the lumpy smoke. If forces do talk to him, they might have been beyond what he could handle: he suddenly pounces on the closest sailor, crushing her throat between his hands. Three more fall before his frenzy drives him overboard with an otherworldly scream. The castaways are cursed, and the sailors mourn their comrades for the rest of the trip.",
  "802726": "Divination? Let's just stop now",
  "802729": "<b>Shark, bottle and messages are thrown overboard.</b> Several sailors protest against the rash decision - they'd have preferred to exhaust all options before giving up, or at least kept the messages to share them at the next harbour. The imagined blame and grief of the castaways haunts them for a while.",
  "802713": "Map the islands matching the partial coordinates",
  "802730": "<b>The search defines a specific area.</b> Many islands match the latitude, but far fewer could be mapped on an actual shipping route. By deducing where the castaways' ship might have gone, your navigators identify a handful of islands which could host the castaways. After two weeks of smooth sailing, your ship reaches the area: a necklace of islands linked by strands of deadly coral reef.",
  "802731": "<b>Your navigator is overwhelmed by the mass of possibilities.</b> Unable to agree on a proper searching method, yet alone define a list of reasonable possibilities, they abandon their task and admit the crew might as well try to work out the contents of the entrails. It's said as a joke, however, some sailors consider the idea.",
  "802714": "There's no time to spare for such things",
  "802732": "<b>The bottle and its messages are thrown back into the sea.</b> The crew's regrets drift away with the bottle, and the castaways are soon forgotten.",
  "802734": "The Mad Preacher",
  "802735": "<b>Your chaplain is going overboard with his preaching.</b> Blaming the expedition's mishaps and misfortunes on the supposed heresy of the ship's officers, the man of faith manages to rouse the gradual distrust and anger of the sailors. His preaching is now part of the crew's daily routine. His words find an echo in the mouths of the sailors, and your lieutenants can see their authority slipping away.",
  "802736": "Demonstrate that his doubts are fuelled by a mental illness",
  "802739": "<b>The man of faith belongs in an asylum.</b> Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon and accuses him of megalomania, listing the traits of the madness: desire for attention, a craving for control, and an overwhelming urge to rouse the paranoia of others in order to match one's own. The portrait is a perfect depiction of the chaplain, and, despite their former affection for the man, the sailors agree that he should be sedated with laudanum for the rest of the trip.",
  "802740": "<b>The doctor only proves his own paranoia.</b> Your doctor interrupts the chaplain's daily sermon with a loud declaration, stating that the man of faith is, in fact, a soul tormented by a mental illness. With all eyes on him, your doctor utters a list of personal opinions rather than medical facts, and the chaplain welcomes his doubts with benevolence. His influence flourishes, and your lieutenants have to make do with him for the rest of the trip.",
  "802737": "Discredit him in a direct confrontation",
  "802741": "<b>Your diplomat has a greater way with words.</b> She silently enters the lower deck during the chaplain's daily preaching, and waits in a corner of a room. When the man of faith finally loses his nerve and asks her what she wants, she lists two hours worth of the chaplain's arguments and, without pause, offers counterpoints for each of them. The humiliation is magnificent, and the chaplain's babbling defence convinces the crew of his puerility. They lose interest.",
  "802742": "<b>Your diplomat was not ready to face the chaplain.</b> She confronts the preacher before the crew, and flaunts her interpretation of the chaplain's mistakes, stating how wrong he is without taking into account the weeks of argument he'd built with his followers. Her diatribe convinces none but herself, and the chaplain simply remarks that her anger is proof of his being right. Your lieutenants have to make do with his whims for the rest of the trip.",
  "802738": "Simply punish him, without taking measures against his ideas",
  "802743": "<b>Not the most diplomatic solution, but it works.</b> Trusted sailors interrupt the chaplain during his daily preaching and drag him to the upper deck, where your first mate welcomes the man of faith with a devoted flogging. The display of violence mostly proves the preacher's point, but the menace of the officers' ire is greater than the crew's distrust in them. The trip resumes in a climate of tension.",
  "802799": "The Night In Jail",
  "802800": "<b>Behind bars!</b> The prolonged stay of your ship in this harbour is not what you intended. Obscure laws were breached, and your whole crew has found themselves arrested under the pretence that the region's borders, whose nature remains unknown, were not respected. Heavily armed foreigners lead your crew through the sinuous roads of their city and into the local jail; after passing by a row of freshly hanged criminals, the sailors are locked up. Only two guards keep watch, their heads bobbing with fatigue. Are they underestimating your crew?",
  "802801": "Poison the guards!",
  "802804": "<b>Just two guards is not enough to contain your science.</b> The doctor brings out a sachet of vials and packets, and produces leathery pouches filled with white powders, some matte, some glittering like sugar. He mixes a bit of this one and a bit of that one, gauging measures with the eye of the seasoned practitioner, then calls to the guards. When the unsuspecting wardens are close enough, the doctor blows the mixture in their face. The men drop dead!",

  "802920": "<b>The rescue team finds their comrades famished and wasted.</b> Your hunters couldn't find sufficient game in the unforgiving mountain, and the diet of molten ice aggravated the wounded's condition past what they could humanely endure. The sailors stagger back to the ship, leaving two dead behind.",
  "802906": "<b>The snow anchor fails your sailors terribly.</b> For most of your crew, a snow anchor is but a vague concept.

  "802922": "<b>An alternate entrance is found after a long while.</b> Alternate is a euphemism: the sailors went deep into the entrails of the glacier, and instead of finding a way into the crevasse, they discerned a fault in the thin ice wall. Breaking it allowed them inside, but their delayed arrival, rather than soothing the fallen men, instead triggers their ire: couldn't they have come faster? Don't they see their freezing limbs? Don't they know the fright they caused?",

  "802934": "<b>The groggy men are cooperating at last.</b> A just dosage of tranquillisers tones down their panic while keeping them conscious, and the wounded let themselves be guided out of the crevasse and back to the ship. When the drugs and the cold wear off, they realise how oblivious they were to the real extent of their injuries.",
  "802935": "<b>Their artificial calm lasts eternally.</b> The dosage of tranquillisers is a bit on the nose, and doesn't even take into account the weakened state of the patients.

  "802936": "<b>They calm down and can finally be rescued.</b> Your sailors are respectful of the wounded's pain and sympathise with them, soothing their angst with empathy and welcomed admiration. The injured stifle their insults and try to live to their companions' expectations, holding their whimpers until they're back on the ship. Their wounds are a nasty sight, but their pride is beaming.",
  "802937": "<b>Their panic soars, pushing them to their death.</b> Your sailors try to motivate the wounded through accurate descriptions of their fate, pointing at their darkened limbs and prophesying their coming fall. The injured enter a state of pure terror, screaming continuously and unable to hear themselves, crawling away from the news bearers and deeper into the chasm, until the snow dampens their screams and the sound of their final fall.",
  "802923": "<b>The glacier forbids your sailors from finding their way through it.</b> The twisting paths of the frozen structure are too much for the crew, who encountered enough trouble following the main marked glacier route. They're forced to abandon their quest, and must instead go back to the broken mantle and its crevasse. The cold steadily bites and weakens them, and they soon take the same purple tint as the men they are trying to save.",
  "802938": "Have the weakened sailors try to pull the others up",
  "802940": "<b>Your sailors' best efforts cannot compensate for the loss of time.</b> The crew's physical ability is excellent, but the cold makes no exceptions when it comes to eating flesh. The wounded are pulled up, and the fangs of ice tear their feet and legs away, the crevasse keeping the trophies as fees for the men's freedom. They're brought back to the ship, but can never truly take part in the expedition again.",
  "802941": "<b>A terrible initiative.</b> Several sailors slip into the crevasse, pushing and pulling the wounded up the frozen walls at the cost of what little energy they have. Their panting draws lines of mist around them, and their faint clouds of breath thicken, and thicken, and suddenly evaporate. There is no more saving to be done for the injured and their rescuers.",

  "802942": "<b>Heartbreaking.</b> Could they have resolved this in any other way? Your sailors try to ignore the question while they point their guns at their companions, men too frozen now to realize what's about to happen.

Your doctor knows what ravages meningitis can do to the mind of its victims, and his collected account of symptoms convinces your crew of your doctor's innocence and acute knowledge. He is free to inspect the men on board, and identifies several others who carry the symptoms. The sick are promptly isolated and disembarked at the next harbour, and your expedition emerges unscathed.",
  "803056": "<b>The doctor's truth isn't convincing.</b> He fumbles through his explanations, as his limited knowledge of the dead man's illness begins to show. Even if the doctor did seem to correctly identify the ailment, he fails to justify the impressive death the crew just witnessed. Doubts linger as the expedition goes on, and the doctor spends the rest of trip isolated in a quarantine of defiance and distrust.",
  "803051": "This was the accusation of a victim",
  "803057": "<b>Heavenly truths hide in the last wishes of a man.</b> The doctor is pressed for answers and asked to swear his innocence before the Lord: a feat too great, and a lie to heavy for him to bear. He confesses to having poisoned the sailor with mercury over a dispute of faith against facts - ironically, the doctor's own fear of the Light made him confess his sins. He is hanged, and your crew find relief in the punishment of the murderer.",
  "803058": "<b>Isn't this judgement too hasty?</b> The doctor is immediately accused of having murdered the sick sailor, but he isn't enough of a believer to confess before the cross. He is nevertheless hanged for his supposed crimes. Relief tints the mood of your crew, but many know the punishment was hasty and unjust.",
  "803049": "<b>Your doctor is at a loss.</b> Fear of the light sounds like an ailment belonging to the realm of the Lord, and the man of science is too blinded by his fright to notice the change in his patient.

The sailor had known of his fate, but chose to endanger his companions regardless. He deserved death.",
  "803066": "<b>Your crew has had enough of the doctor's incapability.</b> The man of science probes the body, tearing its clothes to reveal bruised skin and vulnerable flesh - a sight which convinces the sailors that they have seen the boundaries of his skill.

The crew nod their understanding, silent as your ship sails away. Hopefully they will follow your advice, and most will still be alive when a rescue ship comes to their aid.",
  "803102": "<b>Your frail discipline falls apart.</b> One of your officers and a handful of escorting sailors order the starved men to ration the meat, lest they suffer from even more famine while your ship goes to look for help. Their lack of presence and conviction has no impact on the sailors, who throw themselves on the supplies and transform into beasts; frail animals who lack the strength to rip each other apart despite their will to do so.

  "801614": "<b>No word is brutal enough to describe your opponent.</b> If his plate armor is scaled to match the man inside, then that man is a giant. The human mountain reaches to grab your fighter and crushes his skull like he would an apple. Word of your crew's feebleness and alleged crimes is sent for all cities to know and spread.",
  "801611": "Send your best shot for a pistol duel",
  "801615": "<b>Your gunslinger shoots faster than his own shadow.</b> His opponent drops to the ground before anyone can see or even understand that a gun has been fired, and only the banging sound and fuming barrel testify to the attack. The prince wonders how lucky your sharpshooter is, then reluctantly graces the crew and presents them with compensation for his offence.",
  "801616": "<b>Speed is not in your gunslinger's vocabulary.</b> The prince's duelist, displaying the look of men who fill graves but never dig them, is the sharpest shooter your sailors have ever seen.

The prince buys the sailors' silence and they leave wondering what could have motivated the curious murder.",
  "801618": "<b>A mute would have pleaded better.</b> The officer engages in a battle of arguments with the prince's vizier, and each of his meager claims are met with factual evidence of their contrary.

  "802025": "<b>Your crew crushes them.</b> The collar-grabbed doctor slaps away the hand of the hoodlum, seizes his sleeve and pulls him over his shoulder, sending him crashing into a table. With a roar, the other thugs pounce on your sailors, who greet them with jabs to the chin and sternum, downing the attackers with no more than two hits per man - the seconds for the pleasure of good fighting form. The tavern applauds the action, and the bartender offers a round to celebrate a well deserved beating.",

His crewmates scream for revenge, and look like toddlers agitating their little arms to try and hit the big bad guys. The thugs are not in the mood to play along, and one of them stabs a bawling sailor in the liver to make them shut up. They slowly die as the thugs depart, leaving the tavern in a stupor.",
  "802023": "Offer them a drink to ease the tension",
  "802027": "<b>The language of alcohol is universal.</b> The thugs take you up on your offer, and eye the sailors' purses as they pass the money around to pay for the beers. As the first round arrives, one of the hoodlums speaks up and announces that they will have a drinking contest with the crew. The idea is one-sided, and weirdly different from their previous aggressive attitude.",
  "802029": "Show them the drinking ability of seafarers",
  "802031": "<b>They call that cat piss strong?</b> There's no question regarding who wins the drinking contest: your crew are still standing and enjoying the beers long after the thugs have hit the ground, curled into whatever their stomach rejected. The pungent smell of vomit and cheap ale does not deter the sailors, who casually finish their steins, pay for them, and drag the hoodlums to the closest man of law.",
  "802032": "<b>What kind of liquid fire do they make this with?</b> The crew are used to strong drinks and exotic ales, but the tavern's special mixture of bourbon, sugar and Ricard is way past what they can handle. The thugs are accustomed to this local horror and barely wobble, while your sailors pass out one after the other. When they wake up, obviously, their purses are missing.",
  "802030": "Drug their drinks to avoid the confrontation",
  "802033": "<b>War anaesthetics are remarkably useful against small-time thugs.</b> After a few rounds spent boasting their virile resistance to any kind of liquor, the crew notice the drop in attention of their opponents, and their doctor seizes the opportunity, lacing the incoming mugs with just the right dosage of chloroform. The snoring hoodlums are delivered to the local authorities, who enjoy the unexpected present.",
  "802034": "<b>The dosage doesn't put the thugs to sleep: it kills them.</b> The doctor sidles among the thugs, lacing their drinks and snickering in expectation. Soon the effects appear: the gang shows drowsiness, then nausea, before losing control of their movements and tumbling against the counter, their faces taking on a waxy yellow color. The crew can do nothing as the hoodlums break into seizures and foam at the mouth. They win the drinking contest by default, as murderers of their opponents.",
  "802028": "<b>Bribing them with alcohol doesn't seem to work.</b> Your crew invites the men to sit and share a beer, on them, to try and bring the tension down. The thug doesn't let go of the doctor, and points at the aligned liquors behind the bartender. A glass of all of these, he says, and a bottle of your best whatever. That's way more than they can drink - and way more than your sailors can afford.",
  "802035": "If it's a fight they want, they'll get one",
  "802036": "Pay up",
  "802037": "<b>The crew are humiliated.</b> They empty their purses trying to pay for the excessive demands of the thugs. Ale. Stew. Liquors. Meats. When sunrise pushes the hoodlums to leave the tavern, the sailors are stuck with cooking, dishwashing and dust-wiping until the bartender considers their debt paid.",
  "802024": "This is a waste of time - simply apologise",
  "802038": "<b>Your sailors apologise through gritted teeth.</b> Pleased by their groveling, the thugs don't pester them anymore, yet the heavy stares of the other clients push your crew to leave the tavern. Next time, they'll show them. Next time.",

  "803026": "<b>Sails frozen, food rotten, and a ship on the brink of breaking.</b> It's a blizzard! All notion of time and direction has long been lost: a never-ending tempest of snow surrounds the ship, blurring the limits between night and day, or sky and sea. Stalactites have imprisoned your sails, binding them to the masts and making them creak under the unexpected weight. Your crew fear they might break, but should anyone venture outside while violent winds whip the upper deck?",
  "802991": "Climb the mast and detach the frozen sails",
  "802993": "<b>The ship can safely withstand the blizzard.</b> Several sailors of impressive build climb your masts to unhook and detach the heavy sails, and despite the slippery wood and tightly frozen ropes, they manage to free the masts of the dangerous weight. The barren poles stand tall against the receding storm. Morning light soon pierces the clouds - a good omen to salute your crew's efforts, and accompany their celebration.",
  "802994": "<b>The task is far from easy.</b> Your sailors have good strength, and are used to climbing the masts, but they lack either luck or skill when it comes to speed. Before they can reach the foremast, the foresail breaks out of its bounds and flaps wildly against the weakened mast, while the other sails continue to foster stalactites of increasing length and weight. The foremast emits a shrilling sound of protest.",
  "802996": "Aim at the ties holding the rogue sail",
  "803011": "<b>The rogue sail is taken down!</b> Precise shots take out its ties without so much as scratching the foremast, and the sail is sent to disappear into the storm. The lack of the sail's furious whipping seems to be enough for the mast to hold its ground. When the blizzard recedes, your ship is lacking a sail, but nothing more.",
  "803013": "<b>Alas, your mast is not spared.</b> Your sailors shoot at the ties of the foresail, but the task is too meticulous for them: they shoot at the ropes, the poles, and the mast itself. The raging sail is swallowed by the storm, while the foremast collapses and crushes the starboard. In a final irony, the storm soon calms down, letting your crew see how a lack of meddling would have caused less damage.",
  "802997": "Fire all guns and shake off the ice",
  "803014": "<b>The stalactites are dealt with.</b> In a bold act of defiance towards logic and prudence, your artillery men fire their cannons to send precisely gauged vibrations throughout your ship. The foremast protests but resists, while the pikes of ice parasitising its sails break and rain on the deck in a cacophony of tingling sounds. Your maimed ship has but to wait for the blizzard to run out of breath now.",
  "803015": "<b>Reckless, and proportionately paid.</b> Gauging the difference between power which might break the stalactites only, and power which might also break the mast is beyond the understanding of most humans, your artillery men included. The tremor of the cannons shakes the whole ship, provoking the crashing fall of the foremast. Ironically, the blizzard reacts by calming down, leaving the sailors to their broken ship.",
  "802995": "<b>A resounding failure.</b> Your sailors clearly don't have the ability to climb the masts, whether in this storm or in clear weather - how could they even be allowed on a ship? As they bicker over their deficiency, the main mast beckons their attention: its base is entirely frozen, and the wood screams against the invading cold.",
  "803016": "Strengthen the mast with chains and planks",
  "803020": "<b>A straightforward, if rough solution.</b> Planks and poles are erected around the masts, and bound by ropes and chains in the hope that the swaying barricade will prevent the masts from breaking. Despite its movement, the construction is sturdy, and actually accompanies the masts as they move in the wind, giving them a welcome support. When the blizzard leaves, your ship is plucked naked, but its masts still stand.",
  "803021": "<b>The trigger of catastrophy.</b> Your sailors tie planks and poles around the masts, pulling chains around them as tightly as they can, oblivious to the carpentry laws that apply to the movement of towering objects. The masts try to break free of their man-made prisons, and soon do, crashing onto the deck one after the other. As if chased by the hysteria below, the blizzard flees, lettings its sunrays fall on the barren carcass of your ship.",
  "803019": "Boil seawater to gather ice-melting salt",
  "803022": "<b>Somehow, it works.</b> Your sailors take the time to slowly distil seawater in order to avoid improper condensation. The salt is acquired faster than anticipated, and spread over the base of the main mast, forcing the ice back to its liquid form. The blizzard keeps filling the sails until it runs out of breath and recedes, but the furious weather was enough to greatly maim the ship. There will be extensive repairs.",
  "803023": "<b>There was no chance of success.</b> To gather salt, your sailors keep away from the wind and bury below the deck to light a fire under a pot of seawater. Their condenser is poorly handled, and causes the water to fall back into the pot, leaving the crew to believe the fire isn't burning hard enough. They fan the flames. Hell rises. The blizzard is fed gusts of murky smoke, and spits it back out before receding, revealing the half-burnt carcass of your ship.",
  "802992": "Stay inside and hope the supplies last",
  "803024": "<b>Prudence and faith pay off.</b> Your sailors huddle together in the lower deck, resisting the temptation to go check the masts and their frozen sails. Time trickles away as the storm recedes, and when the blizzard is no more than a light drizzle, the sun emerges to illuminate your ship. It's perfectly unscathed, and slowly drifts towards the coast, where a harbour is already in sight.",
  "803025": "<b>Your sailors' feeble trust is not enough to fuel their patience.</b> The storm lingers, and with each new gust of raging wind the main mast complains and moans, until the distinct sounds of breaking wood resonate through the ship. That's enough waiting! Several sailors rush to the upper deck in the hope of either strengthening or defrosting the mast.",
  "800336": "The Minefield",
  "800337": "<b>At the cry of 'mines!', all rush to the prow.</b> Sure enough, several of the conical terrors bob seductively below. 'Who knows how many of these infernal machines have passed us by, or yet await us. A false move, and this sea shall be a lake of fire! What the devil do we do?'",
  "800338": "Use dynamite to start a chain reaction",
  "800339": "<b>'The way ahead is clear as the eye can see!'</b> says the delighted officer, folding up his telescope.

  "800340": "Try to navigate the minefield",
  "800341": "<b>'We are masters of the sea!'</b> sing the triumphant crew, as the ship weaves easily beyond the last line of mines. 'Even Odysseus, when faced with Scylla and Charybdis, lost men. We have lost none of our company, and our bonds only strengthen!' Soon, a special bottle is being uncorked, and toasts raised to the continued success of the expedition!",
  "800342": "<b>'What was that noise?' gulps the helmsman,</b> but fortunately a metallic scraping is not the prelude to a mighty boom. As the ship is fitfully steered betwixt the mines, hearts palpitate, and sailors wring sweat from their jerseys. When the all clear is finally given, there is not a sailor who fails to offer up a prayer to their goddess.",
  "800343": "<b>While at first plain sailing, the minefield is now gooey with danger.</b> A line of densely-packed mines stand between the ship and freedom. \"With a makeshift device, we might be able to clear the path ahead,\" explains the officer, \"either that, or we just try our best to weave through it.\"",
  "800348": "Build a device",

Relief only comes, of course, once the expedition ship is clear of this last line of mines. 'How did we get in such a pickle?' says one. 'At least we're out of it,' says another.",
  "800350": "<b>A nervous sailor rows towards the line of mines.</b> The makeshift grappling hooks trailing behind his dinghy are intended to drag mines out of the path of the expedition ship. Unfortunately the sailor is a sacrificial goat. A grapple shatters the horns of a nearby mine, and the boat and its sailor explode in plume. Safe passage means nothing to those from whom a good friend was taken.",
  "800351": "<b>The idea is a terrible one from the start.</b> The lengthy poles, comprised of other poles, are unwieldy and inaccurate, even in the hands of a several strong men. The crew's attempt to poke mines away when they draw near is suicide. Two booms come in succession, and a few feeble cheers at escape are drowned by the deafening wails. Few are left to bail water, when so many lie dead or injured.",

You stop by the outpost and pick up anything that looks useful.",

This gives the navigators the difficult task of charting a safe course through the waters. No-one is quite sure if the information given is up-to-the-minute, but when the last line of mines is cleared, all are suitably relieved.",
  "800355": "<b>The documents in the ship archives at first seem exact.</b> A map is discovered showing the mine positions. It is only once a course has been plotted, and your ship is sailing at speed on its supposedly safe track, that a magnificent bang has the whole crew scrambling. The speed seemed to soften the mine's devastation, but there is still a nasty hole in the hull. A second glance at the map shows it is rather out-of-date. The reckless blunder has cost no lives, but the significant task of repair greatly wearies the crew.",
  "800356": "<b>Optimism makes way for abject terror,</b> as the map of mines that is found and used for navigation turns out to be completely false. Terrible detonations devastate the ship's timbers, and countless lives are lost. 'Misinformation is worse than no information,' an officer laments, as his tears bleed the ink of the erroneous chart, which as it happens, refers to a different stretch of water.",
  "800357": "Turn around and try to escape",
  "800358": "<b>A few saintly volunteers approach,</b> offering to scout back the way you came and ease your escape. Asked if they aren't afraid of the cone-shaped mines, they reply 'The lord will see us through.'",
  "800359": "Allow them to go ahead",
  "800361": "<b>The volunteers exude calm,</b> as their lone dinghy traces a path much akin to that which got you into this mess. Although their silent vigil transports you to safety, all agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.",
  "800362": "<b>While the path the volunteers cut is a true one,</b> it does not account for the difference in size between the two ships. It only takes a narrow graze to explode one of the mines, and though no lives are lost, the damage to your ship is significant. The crew are dismayed by the situation.",
  "800363": "<b>For the godless dinghy, doom seems inevitable</b> the moment it drops and a man slops overboard. This inauspicious beginning foreshadows the disaster to follow. Prayers unheard, steering in the rough current proves impossible. The little boat is last seen careening towards the sinister cones it sought to avoid. 'The terrible loss of life shall remain with me all my days,' says a devastated officer.",
  "800364": "<b>It is horrifying that most significant members of the crew</b> are aboard this fragile dinghy. Of course one would not wish a mine to explode any loyal man, but when it bellows up below a collection of your finest, death stings all the more. The crew are understandably devastated at the destruction they have witnessed first-hand. Life feels as if it may never be the same again.",
  "800360": "Tell them to stay on the ship",
  "800365": "<b>Your faith goes untried</b> in the nervous silence, as the ship escapes the mine trap the same way it entered. All agree they should never have ended up in a minefield in the first place.",
  "800366": "<b>Your faith does not go untried.</b> The sinister cones have moved about over time, and no matter how truly the ship follows its original course, it is inevitable a mine will burst into the hull. Luckily when the blast comes, no man dies. Still, the burdensome schedule of repair disheartens the crew.",
  "800367": "<b>None of it is of any use.</b> Your godforsaken crew do not realise how the sinister cones move about over time. No matter how true the course, more than one mine shakes the ship's belly as it limps clear. Many lives are lost, and the damage to the ship is severe.",
  "800575": "Lost in the Desert",
  "800576": "<b>The map of these endless dunes is a swindle.</b> The first officer turns to berate the guide from whom they were purchased, but the fellow is already gone, as if the sands had swallowed him up. A solitary well offers a slight dribble of consolation, but your men must otherwise come to terms with being rather lost.",
  "800577": "Use a reflective object to signal help",
  "800581": "<b>A local rider comes to the rescue.</b> He saunters over on his camel, and explains the well is part of a lost city, accessible over a small rise. The crew are enchanted by the grand quarry, swept over by the sands of time, observations of which shall no doubt bring them fame on their return. After proof of their remarkable discovery has been gathered, the rider is only too glad to lead the elated crew back to more familiar dunes.",
  "800578": "Navigate by the stars",
  "800582": "<b>Clear desert nights are perfect for astronomers.</b> Beneath a black cloak lucid with the constellations, your expert navigators school the remainder in mankind's relation to the heavenly bodies. It is a moment of realisation for many. Enlightened, the crew return to the ship filled with the wonder of the desert and their place in the universe.",
  "800583": "<b>Something of a path appears</b>, though as much by luck as star-gazing. A little way along it, a silhouette crenellates the night - an imposing fortress. Too tired for trouble, you wonder if it is worth knocking at the grand door.",
  "800586": "Ask at the fort for help",
  "800588": "<b>The occupant Sultan welcomes you in.</b> He introduces himself in his own tongue, and is impressed by your interpreters. \"You are far from what you seek. Stay, replenish for the journey ahead.\" Thus the crew enjoy the Sultan's hospitality while they can, for it will ease the last stretch of their journey.",
  "800589": "<b>You lack the means to communicate.</b> Believing you to be an invasion force, the paranoid Sultan orders hot oil be poured from the ramparts. There is no escaping for one, eaten alive by the molten cascade. Resuming your desert path is the only option. The journey is a wearying lament for a fallen friend, meandering slowly back to civilisation.",
  "800587": "Ignore the fort and continue along the path",
  "800590": "<b>It is a long and draining journey.</b> Finally the crew limp exhausted into a settlement, from where it will no doubt be possible to procure the appropriate charts. Most would be happy never to see those grumpy old camels ever again.",
  "800584": "<b>The \"stars are fickle\", say your officers by way of excuse.</b> After travelling for a while, the familiar shape of the well appears in the darkness. Your men have been walking in a circle.",
  "800585": "<b>The stars utterly perplex your party.</b> With romantic notions dashed, the crew look around for some landmark, but instead find a featureless wasteland. They are desperately lost. Water, food and hope are in increasingly short supply. But even in a desert, there must be a way...",
  "800591": "Follow the local wildlife",
  "800594": "<b>Desperate thanks are due to a dung beetle.</b> As it scuttles along, those less capable in coleopterology cast doubt on the value of pursuing it. There is a minor scuffle in the sand before at last the bloody-nosed experts are listened to. The jolly beetle leads to owl dung, and owls in turn to farmland. Thus the embittered and exhausted crew are saved from desiccation.",
  "800595": "<b>A wild goose chase to desolation.</b> Though the ostrich your crew have found cannot fly, it lollops along at surprisingly high speed. They try in vain to follow, but the sun is twice its usual size, and the bird is gone. Hot sand melts soles, and feet begin to swell. The water is out. Those that make it must have some evolutionary adaptation, because for most the desert is to be their graveyard.",
  "800592": "Divine for Water",
  "800596": "<b>Your reprobates have no knowledge of desert mysteries.</b> The divining rod has wasted enough of your time, and your caravan is nearly through the water.",
  "800597": "<b>A pretty price for divine mercy.</b> The Y-shaped stick leads all on a meandering path. One insists on stopping to dig, and is left behind. It is a wasted, and fatal effort. After two days of hardship, the rest stumble over a crest to discover the wide blue sea, their mocking ship upon it.",
  "800593": "Move bravely on",
  "800598": "<b>The sun is unspeakably hot.</b> As the bedraggled lumber back to civilisation, there are wiltings among them. It is too much for the others to turn their heads. Bodies slumping to ash and dust, lost to the waves of a powder sea.",
  "800579": "Wait for a sign of the true path",
  "800599": "<b>Star of wonder, star of light!</b> Your wise magi are stirred by an unusually bright celestial body, that is surely a sign! It foretells a spiritual pilgrimage through the desert leading to a Garden of Eden. A grove of flowing streams, orange and incense, where like-minded devotees congregate. Your crew feel blessed, and the expedition can resume with new-found devotion.",
  "800600": "<b>Are the gods testing you?</b> You wait and wait but there is not yet a sign.",
  "800601": "<b>The omen is a ravaging howl.</b> \"Water in the desert?! it's coming from everywhere!\" Already up to their necks in strong current, the weak swimmers flounder like ants in a bathtub. Those that do not drown must wait until morning to look upon the aftermath. \"A flood from heaven, to punish the wicked,\" say the survivors, as they trudge back to civilisation.",
  "800580": "Walk stubbornly in one direction",
  "800602": "<b>You are extremely lucky to survive.</b> The crew whinge and whine the whole way about scattergun strategy. After a day without shade, a fight even breaks out. But sticking to the fixed heading eventually leads, not before time, back to some kind of reality.",
  "800603": "<b>Your expedition boils.</b> Further and further it goes, into the desert's incandescent interior. Each soul more and more convinced that redemption is over the next dune. But it is not. Three days later, the party might have felt relief at the sight of a caravan, but instead end up wishing they had died with their comrades.",
  "801642": "Scylla and Charybdis",
  "801643": "<b>Your crew attempts the crossing of a vicious strait.</b> Like Odysseus along the coasts of Sicily, they see a subsidiary current running counter to the main flow, its strength so wild it brings fish with deformed eyes and luminescent bellies to the surface. What creatures are not swallowed by this whirlpool end up impaled on the shore's nasty teeth.",
  "801646": "Avoid the whirlpool and maneuver to dodge the shore",
  "801648": "<b>Odysseus didn't have the ability of your navigators.</b> Through a series of tight maneuvers and expert understanding of the furious currents, they drive the ship between the whirlpool and the shore, using the provided momentum to dash ahead. The moment is as brief as it is intense, and the crew rejoice, laughing like children under the cold droplets of crashing waves.",
  "801649": "<b>The maneuver is even more complicated than expected.</b> The ship is driven alongside the whirlpool and flirts with the shore, the racket of the water covering the orders shouted by officers. The current speeds up, inexorably pulling the ship towards the reef.",
  "801651": "Spin the ship to take the damage on its flank",
  "801653": "<b>A frontal crash is avoided, but it is a crash nonetheless.</b> The whole ship protests against the unnatural movement, its rudder straining against the current and its hull complaining loudly against the maneuver until the impact silences it. The repairs are much lighter than they could have been.",
  "801654": "<b>Your navigators cannot control the wild ship.</b> The maneuver sends it spinning and it plunges into the reef prow first. If it weren't for the metal cast protecting the vessel, the crew would have been crushed as well. The repairs, which take place both in the swirling waters and on the knife-like rocks, are excruciating.",
  "801652": "Bombard the shore in an attempt to slow the ship",
  "801655": "<b>Power faces power in a risky but successful attempt.</b> All cannons are fired in the shore's direction, in a surprisingly efficient effort to slow the ship down. The ship lands on the devastated coast and the hull is barely grated by the remains of the broken stone spears.",
  "801656": "<b>What did they expect, attacking nature itself?</b> The massive teeth of stone barely tremble under the cannon's fire, and the recoil is a futile strength against the voracious current. The rock jaw catches the ship and grinds the upper deck, sending several sailors to be served as the strait's daily food.",
  "801650": "<b>Fear clouds the navigators' readings.</b> Unable to choose between several possible courses which could all end in disaster, they opt for a stunned silence and let the crew maneuver on their own. The ship crashes on the shore in an explosion of metal and wood which sends a dozen men overboard and straight into the rock fangs of the coast. It is more a wreck than a ship which escapes the deadly strait.",
  "801647": "Avoid the shore and hope the whirlpool won't suck the ship in",
  "801657": "<b>The sailors' fright gives them wings.</b> The crew reacts to each order with unparalleled speed, too occupied to plead the heavens to think of discussing the risky manoeuvres that are asked of them. When at last the whirlpool is passed, their belief that the Almighty might have his eyes on this ship is stronger than ever.",
  "801658": "<b>There are only so many disasters faith can prevent.</b> When they understand that the whirlpool is a monster none should face, the sailors fall to their knees to pray and beg, abandoning what meaningless impact they could have had on the ship's trajectory. Like Circe prophesied to Odysseus, the currents attack the ship, the men, and a hero.",
  "802115": "The Volcano",
  "802116": "<b>Tremors, ash rain, and an oddly bright night: it's an eruption!</b> The island was too lush and bountiful to be harmless. The lava responsible for the fertile ground creeps from the mouth of the waking volcano, and towards the jungle where a party of your men had erected camp for the night.",
  "802117": "Go back to the ship despite the darkness.",
  "802119": "<b>The ship is quickly found.</b> The burning lights of the volcano illuminate the jungle, and a handful of seasoned explorers lead the rest of the sailors back to the ship, zigzagging between shadows and fleeing animals. The vessel departs as the island is engulfed by flames, a vision as terrible as it is magnificent.",
  "802120": "<b>The sailors are swallowed by the jungle's maze.</b> Dense trees, moving shadows, screeching animals and the crew itself, whose silhouettes are deformed by the scorching heat - too many visions allow panic to spread among the men, who cannot recognise the path, and never make it back to the ship.",
  "802118": "Find shelter against the incoming lava",
  "802121": "<b>Shelter!</b> The crew finds a decrepit stone chapel, the remains of a colonialist power, and deems it better refuge than their cloth-made tents. An officer estimates that the lava will be on them soon: there's no choice but to spend the night here.",
  "802125": "Pray for the chapel to hold",
  "802127": "<b>The chapel miraculously stands its ground.</b> Lava rolls against its walls and forks around the white stone, melting its paint and parching its plaster. Nestled on the only facade left untouched by the flow, the chapel's wooden door seems like the most fragile object the sailors have ever seen. When day comes, they are safe and elated, and all kiss the blessed door before leaving.",
  "802128": "<b>Their faith is nothing but hypocrisy in need.</b> The crew remembers old prayers from their worshipping days, but the years have eroded both their memory and their beliefs. They can only watch as the lava packs against the chapel's stained glass and breaks through. The spray of molten stone and broken glass scars all of them but kills none: a bite to remind them of their lack of dedication.",
  "802126": "Dig trenches in the holy ground",
  "802129": "<b>The trenches are dug with military efficiency.</b> Despite the darkness and the imminent danger, the sailors manage to dig deep trenches in no time, and the pits redirect the lava as it flows down the hill. The sailors bunker down in the chapel as the lava runs around the outside, illuminating the stained glass, leaving them to rejoice in the warm comfort of their shelter.",
  "802130": "<b>Too much pressure and too little grit.</b> The sailors can dig little more than scattered and knee-deep pits, which have a negligible impact on the lava's course. As the crew scurries inside the chapel, so to does the lava, its smoke burning throats and forever robbing the men of their voices.",
  "802122": "<b>Your crew are lost and perplexed.</b> Even your most committed explorers cannot wrap their heads around the complexity of the jungle, which changes with every newly burnt tree. It seems that every path might end in lava-devoured dead ends.",
  "802131": "Follow a random animal and trust its instincts",
  "802133": "<b>The animals run to the beach, and your crew follows.</b> Tracking down the herd of shrill, squealing, screeching critters could be done with eyes closed, and the sailors are led to the shore where they had beached. The ship departs in a hurry, leaving the animals to die in the ruthless volcano fire.",
  "802134": "<b>Your hunters find no pattern in the animals' frenzy.</b> The sailors run in a display of panic and poor judgment, mimicking the animals' desperate behavior. The crew still on the ship can only watch in horror as the island's greatest predator burns all its prey, be they beast or human.",
  "802132": "Pick a random path and trust your instincts",
  "802135": "<b>Fear is the most reliable instinct.</b> The sailors scamper through the jungle, chasing after their lava-lit shadows. They stumble upon the beach by pure miracle, and hop on the ship with molten tongues on their heels. The ship departs with a slightly charred hull, but a safe crew.",
  "802136": "<b>Fear is a treacherous adviser.</b> Seeing that the only unburnt path is up, the sailors climb the jungle's trees in an attempt to escape the lava flow. Ground, then bark, then branches, then humans: everything burns. In the distance, the ship's remaining crew stay transfixed as they witness the volcano island devouring itself.",
  "802138": "Selfless Deeds",
  "802139": "<b>\"They steal your children?\"</b> The air hangs heavy around the sailors as their question withers in the hut. Their hosts consider the explorers, half-hopeful, half-guilty from the certitude that non-paying jobs are not the ones your crew enjoys. One child has to be offered with each new moon, an elder explains as she gestures towards the nearby river, or else bandits raid the surrounding settlements. Tomorrow, the bandits' steamboat will come to claim this village's due.",
  "802140": "Board the bandits' steamer with your gunboat",
  "802144": "<b>Your assault is swift, and without a single casualty.</b> The kidnappers offer no resistance, as their carcass of a craft faces your own fresh-from-the-factory gunboat. They reluctantly lead you to their hideout - a sweatshop with no employees other than the stolen kids. Your crew sets the hideout afire, heads back to the village, and returns the children to their exultant parents. Though they can offer no reward but tears and smiles, your crew basks in the warmth of this priceless payment.",
  "802141": "Shadow the kidnappers back to their hideout with a river skiff",
  "802145": "<b>Your crew navigates through the mangrove with aplomb.</b> The unusual environment doesn't manage to stop their steady rowing, and the sailors soon reach an outpost marking the entrance of the bandits' camp. Sobbing children are taken from the kidnappers' steamboat, and dragged towards a distant barn. Half a dozen armed men guard the building.",
  "802148": "Attack the bandits before they reach the barn",
  "802150": "<b>The bandits don't know what hit them.</b> Using the element of surprise to their advantage, your sailors break into the camp and stifle the children's escorts before they can call for help. They hush the kids, and squat behind what few bushes offer protection, monitoring the other bandits. The attack wasn't noticed.",
  "802152": "Go all out on the bandits and save the remaining children",
  "802154": "<b>The sailors and kids create a breathtaking chaos.</b> The crew shoots and skewers, while the children kick and bite their former oppressors, calling for others to do the same. A deluge of shrieking kids and young adults emerge from the barn and attack the guards, thrilled by your crew's display of strength. The band of unlikely fighters seize the bandits' steamboat, helping themselves to its supplies, before triumphantly returning to the coast.",
  "802155": "<b>Audacity does not make up for their lack of numbers.</b> The crew manages to take down five guards before the noise attracts more armed bandits, and the sailors are driven back to their boat before they can liberate any more children. They flee to the village, and share what they've discovered with the villagers, glad to have freed some kids, but all too aware that many more remain captive.",
  "802153": "Acknowledge the danger, and leave with the children you've already saved",
  "802156": "<b>The decision to run is not a simple one.</b> The sailors recognize how dangerous the assault could be, and retreat to the village along with the few children they've saved. They share what they've discovered with the villagers - and maybe another day, with a subtler approach, more men, and more planning... things could be different. As the ship leaves, the crew focuses more on the good they did, rather than what they could have done.",
  "802151": "<b>The sailors are unfit for a swift assault.</b> Their unchoreographed clumsiness and dissonant roars drives their opponents back not because of their strength, but because of the unconventional display. After an instant of bafflement, the kidnappers shout for others to join them, and the whole gang soon surrounds your crew. They part to let their leader, a beast of a man, face the puny intruders.",
  "802157": "Fight the brute",
  "802159": "<b>Your sailors' cause fuels their victory.</b> Driven by their will to save the children, your sailors do not waver in front of the bandits' leader, all muscles and swords with rage in his eyes. It takes six fighters to face the man, piling up on him in a torrent of dust and groans until he finally stops rampaging. Disheartened by this defeat, and their leader's meaningless pride, the remaining kidnappers are brought to their knees, and the children are freed. The crew returns to the village triumphant!",
  "802160": "<b>The mastodon tramples your sailors.</b> The rescuers lack resistance, and are wiped out by the bandits' leader, their corpses sent flying among the children who can do nothing but watch in horror. In an ultimate act of hatred, a young girl is sent back to her village to retell the carnage, and warn future intruders against trying to rescue the children again.",
  "802158": "Run away",
  "802161": "<b>No sailor is harmed, no child is saved.</b> The crew manage to run back to the village, avoiding the multiple gunshots fired by the kidnappers. That no sailor was wounded is a miracle, but it's hard to celebrate much when the rescue team failed to rescue a single child.",
  "802149": "Hide amongst the trees and wait for nightfall",
  "802162": "<b>The crew becomes one with the trees.</b> Unseen and unheard, the sailors bury themselves in the forest, and observe their future targets. An opportunity arises when a group of bandits leave their posts to bathe in the river: splashing and talking, they don't hear your men approach.",
  "802164": "Steal their clothes to disguise yourselves as bandits",
  "802166": "<b>Your sailors use their disguises to orchestrate the children's escape.</b> Dressed in bandits' rough coats and sashes, the crew infiltrates the barn-turned-sweat-shop, where the children are forced to work. One by one, they lead the kids out of the camp and into their skiff, each child carrying stolen supplies. When the boat finally leaves, the camp is left without fuel, food, or ammunition. It will be some time before the bandits can do any more harm.",
  "802167": "<b>The poorly-disguised intruders are identified and given chase.</b> When asked by an actual bandit about their shift, one of your undercover sailors tries to answer: they fumble and bumble until the bandit grabs them and shouts, \"intruders!\". They make a run for it with the others, leaving both kidnappers and children behind.",
  "802165": "Capture the men and use them as hostages",
  "802168": "<b>A flawless move, from start to finish.</b> After swiftly capturing the naked bandits, the sailors advance, only to discover the camp's true nature: a child-powered sweatshop. It's soon obvious that the bandits' leader is the only one who doesn't care for the hostages, and the man is forcibly exchanged by his crew in return for the promise that your sailors will never set foot in there again. The rescuers return to the village with children on their shoulders, a culprit to be judged, and goods to be shared.",
  "802169": "<b>The naked men overpower your fighters.</b> The element of surprise fails to compensate for your crew's lack of strength, and they're easily repelled by the bathing bandits. Instead of killing them, the kidnappers order the sailors to strip, and send them on their way so everyone can see them for what they are - rescuers who were unable to rescue anyone, and who were humiliated in the process.",
  "802163": "<b>The sailors are not attuned to the notion of stealth.</b> They argue about the best place to hide, and end up lining up behind what could be the thinnest trees in the entire forest, their bulging shapes attracting more than a little unwanted attention from the kidnappers. Their leader, more beast than man, advances to inspect the intruders, and laughs at the puny men.",
  "802170": "Face the brute",
  "802172": "<b>The crew are puny indeed, and they are butchered.</b> The bandits' leader needs no help in fighting your rescuers, who spend more time trying to avoid being hit than actually fighting back. They flee the camp, scatter into the woods, and are hunted down like game. The few sailors who make it back to the coast are so disoriented, they can't even remember the location of the kidnappers' camp, making the deaths of their companions pointless.",
  "802146": "<b>The terrain is not one your crew are used to.</b> They get stuck in the mangrove roots, and their swearing can be heard all the way to the coast. When they manage to get free, the bandits' steamboat is waiting, its railings lined with guns.",

  "802176": "<b>Your bluff works!</b> The kidnappers have a heated discussion before handing over what few children they have onboard, unnerved by the menace your crew just invented. The sailors retreat to the village and return the children to their families, still amazed by their deception, but upset they could save so few.",
  "802177": "<b>They do not buy your bluff.</b> Holding your crew at gunpoint, the bandits casually wait for the reinforcements to show up - but they never arrive. To teach your crew a lesson, the kidnappers grab one of the kids onboard, and cut his tongue before throwing it into your raft: a lesson to you liars. Your sailors withdraw to the village, regretting having only made things worse.",

  "802183": "The children are safe with you, punish their abductors",
  "802186": "<b>Your retribution is ruthless.</b> The kidnappers are still counting up the goods you bought the children with when the crew attacks, and its assault is brutal. The steamboat is set aflame, and the bandits die by fire or bullet. The crew returns the kids to the safety of their homes, but the children now see them as no different from their captors: beasts, driven by violent instincts.",
  "802187": "<b>Your sailors are overpowered.</b> The kidnappers have fought much harder battles against much lesser men, and your crew's attack is dismissed with scorn. The bandits could easily have retrieved the children, but their strange sense of honor makes them consider that goods bought are goods acquired.

  "802175": "Let them be and leave",
  "802190": "<b>There's only so much your sailors can do.</b> They back away under the menace of the bandits' guns, doing their best not to trigger an attack, and row back to the coast. The parents of the abducted children thank them for their effort, but their strangled hopes make their voices break. The sailors leave knowing they could have done better.",
  "802147": "<b>Rather than bandits, the crew finds their leftovers.</b> The bayou's fog makes for a maze your sailors cannot navigate, causing them to lose their quarry. Disturbingly, while trying to find their bearings, your crew ends up making a discovery more harrowing than they could ever imagine: a pit filled both with torn shoes, and their torn young makers. The image stays with them until they try to describe it to the villagers and break down, unable to depict the young faces and their blank eyes. They leave, disgusted by their inability to end this savagery.",

  "802194": "Scare the kidnappers into revealing the position of their hideout",
  "802197": "<b>Your seafarers coerce the river-dwellers into speaking the truth.</b> There is a world of knowledge and pain into your men's eyes, and the bandits are overwhelmed before a single word is spoken. Their hideout is easy prey for your crew, which storms through the den and triumphantly returns the children to their parents, along with the bandits' possessions and supplies.",
  "802198": "<b>The intention is there, but not the result.</b> The bandits recognize your sailors for what they are: sharp-shooters, but weaklings when it comes to close-range confrontation. The crew's threats mean nothing to them. Knowing that these men are the only ones who know where the rest of the children are being held, your crew hands them over to the villagers along with the kids they found, and leave with a feeling of defeat.",

  "802192": "<b>Poor use of your firepower.</b> The sailors handling the cannons are just as important as the weapons themselves. As your crew aren't quite as well-oiled as the machinery, they fail to adjust the quantity of powder being used, firing the artillery to its maximum range without any kind of aiming. They might as well have lit signal fires. The bandits' boat makes a brutal turn and retreats into the bayou at full speed.",

  "802193": "<b>Both bandits and captives are killed.</b> The villagers watch in horror as your ship fires its cannons at the small steamboat as soon as it is in sight, annihilating the frail vessel and all life onboard. Mothers and fathers rush to the water, screaming and crying as tiny bodies slowly emerge. If your crew had a greater control over themselves and the ship, maybe they wouldn't have had to bear the weight of these children's deaths.",
  "802143": "Ignore the bandits and go on your way",
  "802200": "<b>Not all sailors share your lack of compassion.</b> Some men and women refuse to leave, and the officers have no choice but to let them do as they please lest they lose even more of the crew's trust. Many sailors argue that staying to help was the right choice, but the ship has already set sail when they voice their opinion.",
  "802228": "The Deeper You Go",
  "802229": "<b>A boulder-blocked entrance and a booby-trapped corridor: typical Mesoan temple.</b> After a fall down a slide and a crash into uncharted caves, your team of explorers jokes about the situation in an attempt to forget its deathly aspect. They know what people say of Mesoan mazes: the deeper you go, the shinier it gets.",
  "802230": "Follow the suggested route and progress through the traps",
  "802232": "<b>The obvious traps are easily evaded.</b> The sailors contort themselves to avoid sharp stones and plated triggers, flowing through the corridor with the ease of seasoned explorers or cutpurses. They quickly reach the pocket of the temple: a vast chasm crossed by a meager bridge with no handrails. Could this be a trial of courage?",
  "802233": "Cross the run-down bridge",
  "802234": "<b>You pass the trial!</b> As they wave their arms to keep their balance, your sailors brush against ropes suspended around the bridge, hidden by a clever camouflage of paint and shadow play. They grasp the ropes to steady their footing, and a distant mechanism clicks. A rumbling door opens on the other side of the chasm, revealing the exit - and, on its threshold, a shiny artifact.",
  "802235": "<b>Nothing rewards your sailors' recklessness.</b> It's unclear whether the bridge is shaking because of its own frailty, or because of your explorers' quivering legs. Soon the crew are on their knees, creeping across the moldy planks and begging for their mothers. They reach the other side without a scratch, save for their wounded pride, and find a tunnel which leads them outside after some more crawling.",
  "802236": "Climb down the chasm",
  "802237": "<b>The climb is child's play.</b> Rock walls provide a much steadier footing than wind-flogged masts. The sailors reach the bottom of the chasm, where they find an army of ropes stretching into the darkness above: the entrails of the temple's mechanisms! They find what might have been the Mesoan engineers' entrance, and leave the temple with filled pockets and memories.",
  "802238": "<b>The crew aren't as strong as they think.</b> An officer loses her nerve and her grip, slipping down the stone, with a soft thud marking the end of her fall. Smooth slithering sounds hush her desperate cries. The floor is covered in snakes!",
  "802239": "Find a way among the snakes",
  "802241": "<b>The sailors manage to flee.</b> Too occupied by the convulsing mass of the fallen officer, the reptiles don't notice the furtive crew as they tip toes past them and escape through the first tunnel available. The explorers emerge outside the temple, stunned by their survival.",
  "802242": "<b>They cannot read the snakes' behaviour.</b> The sailors progress across the wriggling floor, so focused on their movements that they don't see the mass of snakes backing away from them, and piling against the sole exit. The crew has no choice but to run into the tunnel before it ends up filled with snakes, and several sailors end up as reptile diner.",
  "802240": "Scare the snakes away with torches",
  "802243": "<b>The crew stand their ground as well as they can.</b> The burning torches are swung before the snakes, forcing them back from the sailors. The officer is pulled to her feet and dragged with the rest of the crew through a windy tunnel, leading them outside, empty-handed, but safe.",
  "802244": "<b>What should the snakes be scared of, exactly?</b> Your crew flap the torches around them in a ballet of shaking hands and dripping sweat, but fail to make even one step forward before a young sailor waves his torch past the limits of safety. The snakes leap on your crew, leaving none but a single witness alive.",
  "802245": "<b>The challenge demands more coordination than the crew has.</b> Surprised by the brushing elbow of a comrade, a sailor squeals in terror and jumps back, triggering trap after trap of flying arrows, flaming oils, poison sprays. Once the most sensational traps have simmered down, the roof collapses and seals the exit, as sand slowly starts to fall from the walls.",
  "802246": "Look for a hidden mechanism",
  "802249": "<b>The patterns of the mechanism do not escape your hunters' probing.</b> Upon close and cool-headed inspection, one the sand-spewing hourglass engravings appears to be protruding from the wall. The sailors smash the button, forcing the wall to open and reveal an exit. They flee from the sand, and the temple itself.",
  "802250": "<b>If there is a mechanism, the crew cannot find it.</b> Sand keeps pouring into the room, blinding the sailors as it forces its way into their noses and mouths. The explorers utter muted screams. As the sand packs up against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.",

  "802251": "<b>The old wall caves in effortlessly.</b> Following the sand pouring from the cracks, the explorers identify the wall from which most grains seem to be falling. They stave it in, causing a dusty outpour which fills their lungs, before clearing to reveal sunlight. They hasten through the self-made exit, and end up on the beach on which they'd left their ship.",
  "802252": "<b>The explorers bang on the walls helplessly.</b> Sand keeps pouring into the room, ricocheting off the sailors, blinding them as it forces its way into their noses and mouth. The crew utters muted screams. As the sand packs up against the walls, one of them crumbles under the weight and lets the sailors spill outside of the temple: some alive, most dead.",
  "802231": "Create your own path and push the boulder away",
  "802253": "<b>The boulder moves!</b> The combined effort of the crew manages to lift the giant stone out of its socket. As the boulder rolls, a loud snap resonates and the rock bounces back into place. A wall falls behind the sailors and, in a concert of grating dirt and destroyed stone, it starts to advance towards the crew.",
  "802255": "Push against the wall to stop it",
  "802257": "<b>The ancient wall cannot resist your crew's pressure.</b> They grunt in unison and breathe in rhythm with their effort. One, two. The wall stops in its tracks. One. It shivers. Two. The wall crumbles, revealing a large opening under its railings: the crew finds the body of a less lucky adventurer, one hand clawing at the threshold of a gaping exit, the other gripping an oversized diamond.",
  "802258": "<b>The wall is unfazed by your crew's efforts.</b> As an explorer gets to her knees to pray in the face of her imminent death, she notices an engraving much less elaborate than the temple's decorations: letters that have been scribbled in a language she can actually understand! <br/><b>\"Crawling by day, airborne by night.\"</b><br/>Right underneath the scribbling are four buttons depicting animals.",
  "802259": "Press the sloth",
  "802263": "<b>Wrong answer.</b> The brick above the button opens and an arrow flies into the crew, perforating the throat of a sailor, and leaving a red line in the cheek of the button-presser. The floor under the explorers tilts and they roll, a helpless mass of arms and legs which slides along the tunnel before being expelled outside the temple.",
  "802260": "Press the bat",
  "802264": "<b>Wrong answer.</b> As she presses the button, the sailor feels no resistance, and keeps pushing the carved stone until her full arm is in the wall. She can feel something furry on her skin, a little bit rough, and a bit... She screams! As fangs dig into her flesh, a legion of bats emerge through the newly opened wall - and the only way out is through the bats' nest. The crew emerges from the temple covered in blood, and crippled with a lasting fear of the dark.",
  "802261": "Press the butterfly",
  "802265": "<b>Right answer!</b> The sailor hits the butterfly button and celebrates as the wall stops advancing, and bricks whirl into the floor to form a staircase. The crew emerges from the temple, wondering about the intentions of whoever thought to carve such needlessly complicated riddles in their mother tongue.",
  "802262": "Press the cockroach",
  "802266": "<b>Wrong answer.</b>As the cockroach is pressed, the insect shivers and shakes the dust off its shell. It's alive! The ceiling opens and a swarm of cockroaches flies into the room, aiming for the sailors' mouths. The crew smash the insects with whatever objects they have at hand, their horror giving them wings of their own, pushing them to climb the walls until they reach the outside.",
  "802256": "Look for another way out",
  "802267": "<b>The unfazed explorers rapidly find an exit.</b> They notice how the floor's cobblestones move to let the advancing wall pass, and wait for the right moment to jump into the space between wall and floor. One by one, they land into the room below, where a large opening to the outside lets in the morning light, revealing a spectacle of spiderwebs surrounding a delicate piece of sculpted mahogany.",
  "802268": "<b>The sailors do not find an exit.</b> All stones look alike, and the crew lacks the ability to appraise which rock might be more important than the others. The advancing wall looms ever closer, ready to crush their bones, before suddenly leaning forward and pushing the sailors to the floor, which in turn opens to eject the explorers outside the temple. Yes, they are alive - but the very sight of a stone wall will scare them for years to come.",
  "802254": "<b>The boulder doesn't move.</b> Your explorers push, nudge and thrust, but the exit stays sealed. They have no choice but to obey the maze's invitation.",
  "802470": "The Storm",
  "802472": "<b>This tempest is beyond anything you have ever faced.</b> The smell of salt is everywhere. The freezing water pierces everyone. The winds and waves hit your ship with impossible violence, making the vessel groan and tremble with each new strike, the air so full of sea-spray one could drown in it. Is there anything mere humans can do in the face of such godlike wrath?",
  "802474": "Pray that the usual method will work and reef the sails",
  "802478": "<b>Trust in your habits pays.</b> Years of executing the same maneuvers have ingrained them into your crew's instincts. The sailors reef sail after sail despite the poor visibility - they do not need sight, for they are guided by the invisible hand of practice. Only the fore and aft sails are left to flail in the wind to keep a semblance of control over the ship.",
  "802481": "Sail through the storm",
  "802483": "<b>The vessel emerges from the storm, unscathed.</b> The barren masts of your ship part the tempest as the crew maneuver its jib sails and the spanker, both ridiculously small pieces of cloth in the face of the storm's fury. Still, the maneuver magnifies the importance of these sails and allows you to masterfully skirt the storm, leaving the curtain of rain just as lightning begins to strike. Entranced, the crew contemplates how they managed to defy such a grand power.",
  "802484": "<b>Waiting would have been a better option.</b> Though the force of training helped your crew reef the sails, it doesn't reveal how to navigate the furious tempest. Sailing with nothing but the jib sails and spanker is a feat no one on your ship is capable of. The vessel is tossed about helplessly, until the storm decides to calm down.",
  "802482": "Wait for the storm to pass",
  "802543": "<b>The storm passes.</b> With the sails reefed to avoid damage, the sailors have only themselves to care about: they bury under the deck in wet bundles, shivering under the biting cold of the unremitting downpour. The endless wait is dispelled by a timid sun, and the expedition can finally resume.",
  "802479": "<b>What is faith in yourself against the rage of the heavens?</b> The sails thrash against their mast, escaping the hands of your sailors as they desperately try to reel them in. The freezing rain becomes hail, and the crew's strength melts under the relentless pounding. About half the sails are secured as the first bolts of lightning crackle over the horizon.",
  "802486": "Order the crew to finish reefing the sails",
  "802488": "<b>Just in time!</b> The lieutenants' preaching hits the sailors harder than the hail itself, and the crew pours their last drops of effort into reefing the remaining sail. As they finish attaching the spanker, the full strength of the tempest hits the ship. To the relief of the crew, the reefed sails take no damage, but the ship lurches helplessly, carried by the whims of the storm until it finally calms down.",
  "802489": "<b>There's no courage in these cowards.</b> Despite the repeated calls of the lieutenants and the urgency of the situation, the sailors stay frozen in the face of the thunderstorm, awed mice before a famished cat. You can beat them into life, or say your prayers.",
  "802490": "Threaten to flog them",
  "802492": "<b>The threat works.</b> The perspective of a flogging somewhat outweighs the menace of the thunderstorm, and the sailors resume their work in a panic. The sails are reefed and secured right before the heart of the storm crashes into your ship. Letting the tempest haul you through the ocean is not a pleasant experience, but at least the sailboat didn't take any damage.",
  "802493": "<b>The threat of punishment is weak and unwarranted.</b> Rendered distraught by the storm and unable to gather their wits, your lieutenants have no power over the crew. Your sailors are too busy saving their skins to mind orders, especially when given with so little conviction. Your ship is consumed by the tempest, chewed up, ground down and spat out. Its skeletal remains drift away from the storm.",
  "802491": "Pray the storm will end",
  "802496": "<b>Your prayers are heard.</b><br/>\"A thousand may fall at your side, <br/>Ten thousand at your right hand, <br/>But it will not come near you. <br/>You will only observe with your eyes, <br/>And see the punishment of the wicked.\"<br/>As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.",
  "802497": "<b>The thunderstorm hits your ship with full force.</b> Call it divine punition or pure coincidence, but the tempest gathers around the vessel, and hell begins. Lightning strikes the masts and tears through the sails, igniting brief fires that are immediately doused by the hail. The deck is water, the ship is a wave - and it crashes against the sea, again and again. When at last the first sunrays bless the sailboat, its shape is left torn and mangled.",
  "802487": "Maneuver with what sails you have left",
  "802498": "<b>To safety!</b> Maneuvering with only half your sails while facing oversized waves, pounding hail and incoming lightning is as difficult as it sounds. And yet the crew does it. Relying not on the sails, but on the ship's bilge keel and its keel-protecting apron, they spear through the wind without being driven sideways. The boat leaps over the trough of the waves, pushed by the raging force of the elements, offering as much resistance it can possibly can - until, at last, the tempest is left behind.",
  "802499": "<b>A close call.</b> Navigating with so few sails proves more difficult than expected, and the proximity of the thunderstorm makes the sea even wilder. The ship rolls among the gigantic waves, lifted and shifted by the whims of the tempest. The crew's maneuvers amount to choosing which less terrible wave they wish to crash into. When the storm recedes, the damage is somewhat acceptable.",
  "802500": "<b>Too slow.</b> The crew's skills are limited to classic sailing, perhaps in a bit of bad weather, but not in a storm of this magnitude. And not on a ship with half its sails reefed, and the other half flailing in the gale. Ignoring the urgency of the free sails, the sailors try to maneuver the ship, and manage to present its full flank to the waves. The tempest gladly takes the offering. It crashes into the ship, tearing both sails and men from it, before spewing the remains into calmer seas.",
  "802475": "Frenzied measures for frenzied times: open all sails and ride the storm",
  "802501": "<b>Riding the wild wind isn't dangerous enough for your crew.</b> In a display of complete control over the ship, they somehow manage to find an invisible corridor of safe passage among the waves. The gales that should have torn the sails apart instead fill them, making the sailboat dance with a majesty at least as grand as the storm itself. Instead of leaving the tempest, the crew rides it until it calms down on its own, exhausted from carrying its new masters.",
  "802502": "<b>A move as wasteful as it was risky.</b> Meek doesn't even begin to describe your sailors' approach: they deploy the sails in an incoherent manner, letting the wind take hold of the ship. The vessel yaws to one side, then to other, its rudder barely in contact with the water. A wave grabs a sailor and runs away with him. Any more of this, and the whole crew will follow!",
  "802503": "Time the anchor's release to counterbalance the ship",
  "802507": "<b>A bold move!</b> Releasing the anchor right as the ship reaches an upright position and begins to yaw is the perfect timing to stop the chaotic rolling. The sailboat protests against the maneuver, trembling under the insistence of the waves, but obediently follows your crew's demands as they finally steer it away from the storm. Unnerved but alive, the sailors agree that they have seen and done enough risk-taking for the day.",
  "802508": "<b>A move too bold.</b> Timing the anchor's release to the yawing of the ship takes more competence and composure than your crew can muster. The iron cross drops as the ship rolls to the opposite side and, instead of driving the ship back to a steady position, the anchor grinds against the flank, tearing planks and railings as it falls. The waves finish the job. When the storm finally recedes, the ship is adrift, its flank gutted.",
  "802504": "Fill the bottom of the hold to keep it steady",
  "802509": "<b>Safe and sound.</b> Ignoring the battering rain as they navigate the pitching deck with skill, the sailors organise a human chain to store the upper deck's goods in the depths of the ship. The temporary ballast, accompanied by the human weight of the sailors, manages to lower the waterline and quells the ship's rolls. Hidden in the hull, and unable to do any more for their ship, the crew must wait for the storm to calm down on its own.",
  "802510": "<b>Mayhem.</b> Disheartened by the enormity of the task, the sailors hardly listen to their lieutenants. Four crew members attempt to follow orders and unfasten the deck's supplies, only to have them roll away and slide across the deck as the ship pitches in the storm, knocking down sailors and pushing them overboard, before breaking the ship's railings and toppling its weakened masts. When the sun emerges, it reveals the emaciated silhouette of a ghost ship.",
  "802476": "Use the steam engines to carefully follow the trough of the waves",
  "802511": "<b>Slow and steady.</b>Maybe too slow? Careful maneuvers keep your ship under favourable winds, and keep the menace of transverse waves at bay, but the storm shows no sign of relenting.",
  "802513": "Overheat the engines to outrun the storm",
  "802515": "<b>A power stronger than the elements themselves.</b> Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit; the screw propeller moving far beyond what human sight can perceive, propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.",
  "802516": "<b>You should have been more patient.</b> The crew cannot manage such a brusque change of pace, and their meager knowledge of the machinery is not enough to demand so much from the engines without paying an equivalent price. The ship vaults away from the storm in a cacophony of complaining metal and agonizing devices - when at last the tempest is gone, the engines require your immediate attention and repairs.",
  "802514": "Maintain a steady pace and let the storm push you off track",
  "802544": "<b>A negligible change of course.</b> Letting the storm push your ship as it pleases upsets the most hot-headed sailors, but those with an actual brain upstairs appreciate the prudent approach. When the storm recedes, the ship's slight change of course takes a full week to be corrected - a decent trade-off in exchange for your safety.",
  "802512": "<b>You would have been better off with a windjammer.</b> Navigating the ship through the storm proves trickier than expected, and the navigators' lack of familiarity with steam ships shows as they rely on the sails to maneuver, despite the ship's peculiar lack of a middle mast. It doesn't take long for the ship to protest against the poor handling. It yaws, and a loud rumble erupts from the hull: the ballast has come unfastened!",
  "802521": "Fasten the ballast back into place",
  "802523": "<b>Your prayers are heard.</b><br/>\"A thousand may fall at your side, <br/>Ten thousand at your right hand, <br/>But it will not come near you. <br/>You will only observe with your eyes, <br/>And see the punishment of the wicked.\"<br/>As your priest intones, perched atop the bow, so does the storm seem to soften. A miracle? When the skies clear, however, it would appear that some sailors were judged to be wicked.",
  "802524": "<b>Too heavy, too dangerous.</b> Your sailors are ill-prepared to handle the massive basalt stones that act as ballast. They try to secure the stones in place, but the ship continues to pitch: their footing is unsteady, and the rocks are so, so heavy. A sudden yaw sends the basalt rolling into them, and your sailors are knocked down, crushed like clay figures. There is nothing more to be done but wait for the ire of the tempest to pass.",
  "802522": "Make use of the steamship's sails to survive",
  "802525": "<b>You run a pretty decent storm jib!</b> Navigating the steam ship like a good old sailboat, the navigators rely on the sails alone to steady the ship's erratic movements, and strain the rudder this way and that. It is fearless! The gale hits the wet sails with all its might, inflating them to their limit, as the sudden force breaks the ship out of its pitching. The navigators seize the opportunity to escape the storm, to the delighted clamour of the crew.",
  "802526": "<b>Disaster.</b> Proving once more how inept they are at navigating this ship, your sailors attempt that which should never be attempted: they try to go against the wind. As the ship twirls, a gale strikes it with full force, transforming its yaw into a full-length broaching. The masts plunge into the sea, and there is no more up or down, and no more sky or deck. Everything is water. When the seas drain away, allowing the ship to sway back into position, there is no trace of the sailors taken by the storm.",
  "802477": "Overwork the steam engines to boldly escape the storm",
  "802527": "<b>A power stronger than the elements themselves.</b> Through skillful manipulation of the engines, the crew pushes the machinery to its utmost limit; the screw propeller moving far beyond what human sight can perceive, propelling the steam ship with remarkable speed. The vessel breaks through the waves and away from the storm in a thrilling display of man-made might.",
  "802528": "<b>The delicate machinery is handled brutishly.</b> Assuming that the engine's heat is directly proportional to the ship's speed, the engineer overheats the steamer and brings the boiler way over capacity. The temperature rises, the pressure swells and the metal quivers, until one of the engines explodes, killing the engineer on the spot.",
  "802529": "Attempt to use the remaining engine without your engineer",
  "802531": "<b>An unexpected turnaround.</b> A sailor steps forward: she's spent the trip observing the engineer, she says, and thinks she can handle the machinery. The lack of other volunteers, frightened by the engineer's death, leaves her the only candidate. She handles the remaining engine with a notable, if amateurish skill, and the steam ship emerges from the storm in one piece. Still, several sailors whisper about the ill luck of letting a woman save them.",
  "802533": "<b>From bad to worse.</b> The sailors have even less skill than the engineer who, let us insist on this point, died while trying to practise his specialty. The crew tries to push this thing and pull that other thing. The pieces of metal are kicked to the best of the crew's abilities, until the air pump's valve bursts open, filling the entire room with burning steam, and forcing the sailors outside. The valve must be closed, and a volunteer offers to face the miniature hell.",
  "802534": "Forget engineering, and hope the Lord will protect the volunteer",
  "802537": "<b>If not skill, at least courage is rewarded.</b> The volunteer rushes inside the engine room to close the leaking valve, screaming a Glory Be as the steam broils his skin. Both steam and storm recede once the valve is slammed shut, and the crew can take its time repairing the abused machinery. The volunteer spends the rest of the trip preaching the Lord's grace, his incessant sermon making the other sailors regret the tempest and its terrifying shrieks.",
  "802538": "<b>Hell indeed.</b> Whether the volunteer lacked faith, or the Lord lacked attention, it is only for Him to know. The man enters the engine room and can hardly touch the leaking valve before the steam devours him whole, large blisters feeding on his flesh while the whistling valve covers his screams. There is no distinguishing the man's agony from the machinery's cries, and the door is hurriedly sealed shut. The inhumane shrieks continue to resound through the ship for the rest of the trip.",
  "802536": "Insist on using your crafting wits, and protect him yourself",
  "802539": "<b>The best of a spread of bad options.</b> The volunteer penetrates the engine room wrapped in layers of wet cloths, as the crew provides ventilation by rapidly opening and closing the door, avoiding the steam with damp armour of their own. The man manages to close the valve, and the rest of the steam is evacuated in the same ridiculously plain manner. The immediate danger is avoided, and the crew wisely decides to avoid any more risk-taking, and wait for the storm to end on its own.",
  "802540": "<b>Don't you know when to stop?</b> The sailor covers himself in damp cloths and enters the engine room, only for the steam to contaminate his wet armour with its insufferable heat. He springs from the room covered in blisters, a monster of molten skin which howls agony beyond human comprehension, his cries echoed by the tempest itself. The steam follows him out of the room, and burns all the sailors within its grasp, taking delight in the stolen flesh until it finally recedes, replete thanks to the stubbornness of the crew.",
  "802530": "Shut off the engines and rely on your sails",
  "802541": "<b>Audacious!</b> Abandoning the steam engines, the crew focuses its efforts on using all available sails on the ship. The sailors may not have faced tempests this grand before, but they have crossed seas and braved oceans aboard all kinds of vessels: navigation is in their blood. They face the winds, ignore the waves, and lock the steering wheel into place, allowing the ship to stay steady until the storm passes. Not the most natural of solutions for a steam ship, but a good display of skill nonetheless.",
  "802542": "<b>Reckless!</b> Attempting to face the tempest without the ship's main power source is folly, and the crew cannot handle the safety sails as well as they imagined. They try to face the waves to break their momentum, but the ship's mishandling lets it drift - and offers its flanks to the tempest. When the sun finally pierces the clouds, it reveals a spectacle of lacerated sails, flooded supplies, and disgruntled sailors.",
  "802609": "The Mountain Maw",
  "802610": "<b>Your sailors face the mountain without a map.</b> After racing from guide to guide through the depths of the mountain range, the crew find themselves devoid of a chaperone: the guide supposed to take them on the last leg hasn't shown up at the time you agreed. Forget what initial goal you had in mind - getting off the snow-topped peak is the only priority now.",
  "802611": "Traverse the mountain on your own",
  "802613": "<b>Your navigators make do without a guide.</b> They take note of landmarks as they progress, relying on their compasses to follow a single direction, staying put during the night despite their dwindling supplies. At long last, they find a stream of melted snow, and follow it downhill to the foot of the mountain. The crew survived, but it was a tough effort.",
  "802614": "<b>A guide would have been helpful.</b> Your sailors navigate the mountain paths to the best of their ability, but they aren't skilled enough for the task at hand. The narrow roads disappear beneath the mist of the snow and branch out around the skeletal trees, forcing your crew to spread out. When the explorers reach a decent camping ground and count their numbers, five of them are missing.",
  "802618": "Go forward, leaving marks for the lost sailors to follow",
  "802620": "<b>The foot of the mountain, at last.</b> The crew progress step by step, testing the frozen snow for gaps while leaving piles of stones for the lost sailors to follow. Building the landmarks takes time, but it helps avoid any backtracking. The main group is soon joined by the missing sailors, who are disgruntled at having been left behind, despite the crew's best efforts to guide them. Soon their ordeal is over, however, as they reach the end of the mountain range in silence, left speechless with relief.",
  "802621": "<b>The explorers get more lost with each passing day.</b> They venture deep into the mountain and quickly abandon the idea of leaving marks for the lost sailors, too concerned for their own survival. The frost solidifies their clothes, steals their toes and rots their food.",
  "802622": "Follow a stream of melted snow running downhill",
  "802625": "<b>Your sailors manage to follow the stream to the foot of the mountain.</b> The stream flows in and out of the frozen ground, playing hide and seek with the desperate crew. They are not the only ones using the trickle as a guide: just before reaching the plains below the mountain, they meet with the missing sailors, who are quenching their burning thirst in the meagre snow stream. It's unclear which of the two teams is the most pitiful, but all are alive.",
  "802626": "<b>Where did they come from? Where should they go?</b> The melting snow splits into a web of entangled streams, which buries under the ground and resurfaces without any apparent logic. The crew are taken by the illusion that the forest around them is flat, and can no longer tell if they are climbing or descending. They split like the streams themselves, to each sailor their trickle - but like the streams, not all of them find the foot of the mountain.",

Three steps to that rock. The snow parts as they advance, drawing dark trenches which run across the pure white mantle, and which eventually - finally - reach the foot of the mountain. The crew stumble and fall in relief when they realise they made it out alive.",
  "802628": "<b>The sailors are too weakened by the cold.</b> They dig through the powder snow, only for it to collapse in again without revealing any safe path. Their endurance crippled by the frost, they abandon the task and try to focus on less demanding options.",

  "802629": "<b>The crew extend their stay in the cold to gather supplies.</b> Game is scarce, and hunting takes time. However, the food makes for a decent meal, and the smell of roasted hare fills the sailors' stomachs almost as well as the meat itself. The light from the fire spreads through the forest at night, and beckons the missing sailors. Reunited, the crew avoid talking about abandoning their companions, and they leave the mountain in silence.",
  "802630": "<b>Your hunters fall prey to the mountain.</b> Animals' tracks sprinkle the fresh snow, but their owners are invisible, hidden in holes and burrows. The hunters are unused to such terrain. As they progress through the forest, discussing where snares could be most efficient, the frozen ground suddenly breaks beneath them, and a handful of sailors fall into a deep fault.",

  "802631": "<b>The missing sailors are found, and with them an exit.</b> The idea of losing their companions pushes the hunters to persevere. Broken twigs, brushed moss, mud splashes: everything is a hint. They follow the trail to a crossing and find the lost sailors, who welcome them heartily: better yet, they've found a beaten path which leads straight to the foot of the mountain! That they believed in the others and waited for them is a reward in and of itself.",
  "802632": "<b>The fresh snow hides the dangers underneath.</b> A powdery white frosting covers everything in sight, and the skies melt into the ground, disguising the horizon. The hunters advance on instinct alone, unable to spot any hints of their previous passage. They find the missing sailors only by encountering the same fate: the frozen ground breaks under their weight. The thin crust of ice hid a fault! Three of the lost men are down there - and two hunters just joined them.",
  "802633": "Pull the sailors from the fault, at the risk of falling",
  "802637": "<b>The rescue comes at the price of their remaining strength.</b> It takes ten sailors to get one man out of the fault: three to pull, six to hold and one to keep an eye on the trembling layer of ice. The snow weighs them down, pushing when they pull, hissing when they call out. When the last sailor is hauled from the rift, both the rescuers and rescued are broken. They drag themselves downhill. and manage to leave the clutch of the mountain.",
  "802638": "<b>The ordeal is much bigger than your sailors.</b> They launch ropes into the rift, but the slippery walls of ice cannot be climbed. The rescuers attempt to haul the others up, and they plant their feet into the ground, pulling, heaving and panting, their physical reserves long drained by the cold. As they fall to their knees and break their nails on the frozen hemp, the rift cracks, and the mountain opens its mouth wide. The crewmates it swallows are never seen again.",
  "802634": "Abandon them and continue downhill",
  "802639": "<b>Salvation at the price of their humanity.</b> Ignoring the begging screams of their companions, the sailors make a large detour to avoid falling into the frozen rift. As they find a beaten path heading downhill, a sailor catches up to the group, panting: he admits to having thrown some pickaxes and ropes down the fault. The crew congratulate him for his selflessness, and pretend his good deed is enough to ease their conscience.",
  "802612": "Retrace your tracks",
  "802640": "<b>The path is easy to recognize, but it is tortuous and unforgiving.</b> The crew fight against the elements, hurrying through the mountain passages with haste, lest their tracks disappear and leave them without hints to follow.

  "802642": "Blood, Oil, Sweat and Tears",
  "802643": "<b>An overweight ship is easy prey for stormy waves.</b> The oil merchants your crew met at the last harbour paid good money for their cargo to be stored aboard your ship, but the weight isn't really something your vessel can handle. At the first signs of tempest winds and cutting waves, the unusual ballast makes your ship heel furiously.",
  "802644": "Release the stern anchor",
  "802646": "<b>Safe.</b> The cast-iron shank of the anchor plunges into the shifting waves with a large splash, the amount of chain being just right for it to take a good hold of the seabed. The ship wobbles, washed by the winds and the waves, but manages to stay put. The sailors simply wait for the storm to pass, and hope the extra load will not cause any more problems.",
  "802647": "<b>A miss - the crew should go hide in the lower decks.</b> The anchor is released, its chain unravelling by itself more than it is controlled, and the large iron cross reaches the bottom with too much play to properly grip the sea floor. As it becomes apparent the anchor won't be of any help, the lieutenants order the crew to descend to the bottom decks of the swinging ship - but the oil merchants refuse to leave the apparent safety of their upper cabins.",

Their stoicism more than their arguments convinces the merchants to follow the orders, and they join the rest of the crew on the lower deck until the storm comes to pass.",
  "802651": "<b>A waste of time.</b>Pressed by the urgency of the situation and unable to get their thoughts in order, your lieutenants cannot properly convince the merchants. As they begin to lose their nerve, the ship swerves and slams into the shore. Whistling winds invade the perforated hull, and water seeps in its wake.",
  "802652": "Repair the hole while the water is still pouring",
  "802654": "<b>Your crew are used to making repairs in poor conditions.</b> Ignoring the swinging floor, the sailors focus on the hull, their legs deep in the pouring water. Drenched supplies lap around their legs as they fight to plug the hole. The seal will not last long, but it should hold until the next harbour.",
  "802655": "<b>Your crew's speed cannot match the water's.</b> Overwhelmed by the current, and unable to prioritise their tasks or even shape a plan for the repairs, the sailors quickly abandon the idea of patching up the hull. They flee to the upper deck, and brace themselves as the ship crashes on the shore. The repairs take weeks.",
  "802653": "Move the ballast to lift the hole above sea level",
  "802656": "<b>The forced instability protects the ship.</b> Your sailors huff and puff as they push the large sacks of basalt stones across the belly of the ship, progressively tipping the vessel's balance until its pierced flank leans away from the water. The ship is carefully led to the shore, where the crew can finally start repairs.",
  "802657": "<b>A ludicrous plan.</b> Your sailors wheeze and gasp as they try to pull the basalt sacks, but their efforts are not enough to make the ballast budge. The ship remains level, allowing more and more water in, as it sinks under the intrusion. Several sailors drown, trapped between the deck's roof and the swirling currents, and their bodies cannot be evacuated before the storm calms down.",
  "802649": "Drug them to avoid losing any more time",
  "802658": "<b>Safe and drunk.</b> The merchants accept the liquid courage and drink its laced contents, falling asleep before they can finish their bottle. They're dragged to the lower deck along with the rest of the crew and whatever supplies the sailors could carry, their combined weight counterbalancing the pounding of the waves. The storm soon calms down, leaving the crew to deal with the hangover of their passengers.",
  "802659": "<b>Too weak.</b> The drinks your sailors offer the merchants in an attempt to soothe their anger are far too poorly made to have any kind of impact on them. As they continue to struggle against your crew, a vivid growl resonates through the ship. You came too close to shore, and the reefs have pierced your hull! Water starts to pour into the lower decks.",
  "802645": "Improvise a sea anchor on the surface of the water",
  "802660": "<b>The sea anchor works as intended.</b> Your sailors quickly cable up a weighty assemblage, and after fastening it securely, let it drop into the waves. It pulls against the water to increase the ship's drag, gaining it enough stability to keep its broadside away from the waves. The crew, relieved, can wait for the storm to pass.",
  "802661": "<b>The sea anchor sinks as soon as it touches the water.</b> The sailors tack together some extra sails to try and assemble a sea anchor, but the ballooning cloths snap as soon as they're thrown into the waves. As the ship is pushed towards the shore, the backwash gets more and more ample, until a rogue wave of ludicrous proportions rises above the sea. The merchant passengers beg your crew to save them!",
  "802662": "Face the wave head on",
  "802665": "<b>Fearless.</b> Despite the battering gale and clobbering currents, your crew manage to keep the ship straight, as you face the rogue wave head on. The wave crashes into your vessel with all its rage and natural power, but the straight bow cuts its fury in two, and the ship avoids most of the damage - a rock among the waters. When the storm calms down, your crew focus on the repairs, and consider how exceptional their survival was.",
  "802666": "<b>Too audacious.</b> The gusts of wind fill your sails, and the frantic currents pull at your hull. Your crew are far too untrained to keep control over the ship. Entailed by the sea's passion, the ship leaps and falls, dancing until the shore catches it and stops its mad waltz. The vessel's carcass finally remains still, as water and bodies flow from its bent silhouette.",
  "802664": "Throw the oil cargo overboard to calm the seas",
  "802669": "<b>The water's anger dies out!</b> Moving the merchants aside with ease and dismissing their plea, your sailors heave the oil barrels over the railings, and let their contents spill around the ship. The oil hugs the water and rolls over the waves, dissolving the wind's grip, and slowing the water's movement. The threat of the waves is no more, but the merchants' trust and cargo were lost in the process.",
  "802670": "<b>Their greed overcomes your strength.</b> The sailors first try to reason, and then try to force the merchants into giving up their precious oil, but your crew are weak in both body and spirit, while the merchants built their fortunes on hard-headedness.

  "803310": "<b>Hard to avoid what you cannot see.</b> The whales are everywhere: on the sides, in front, at the back, and beneath the ship. The captain strains against the limits of his skill, but he cannot avoid the impacts coming from below, and part of the cargo is sent flying before the ship can escape.",
  "803311": "<b>A school of whales is not a road you can simply navigate.</b> As the ship shifts to the side, the closest whale reacts to the sudden movement by playing dead: it stops swimming, and lets itself fall at an agonizingly slow speed. The impact with the rudder is brutal, and bends the vital mechanism.",
  "803312": "Attack! Harpoon the closest animal",
  "803313": "<b>A feat of strength for a gratuitous kill.</b> The harpoon impales the leading whale, and the rest of the school collides with its body, their advance being suddenly, and brutally stopped. The ship leaves without a scratch.",
  "803314": "<b>The harpoon strikes a calf, causing the school to attack.</b> The wounded whale swirls to try and get rid of the iron rod, and its elders surround it, pushing the ship away from their young. The boat lists heavily to the side, and several men fall overboard.",
  "803315": "Throw a roped harpoon to save the drowning sailors",
  "803316": "<b>A harpoon is sacrificed to rescue the men.</b> The men grab the harpoon's anchoring rope and climb back on board, just in time to see the rope snap and fall into the abyss. The ship flees before any whales resurface.",
  "803317": "<b>The rescue harpoon triggers the whales' attack.</b> The roped weapon could have made a good rescue device, but the giant marine mammals were already restless from the previous throw. A whale simply tilts up its head, and a massive wave engulfs the drowning sailors, crashing against the ship, and ramming it away from the begging and screaming men.",
  "803318": "Get away from the flustered whales",
  "803319": "<b>The fate of the drowning men is sealed.</b> As the ship retreats from the whales, the captain prays aloud for the sailors' survival. No one among the crew is naive enough to believe his words, but they all pretend.",

A tale of dancing whales will be part of this expedition's story!",
  "803322": "<b>The performance's efficiency is questionable.</b> Trying their best to be in unison, the sailors shout their hearts out more than they sing, and the underwater creatures don't seem to care. The group screaming occupies the crew for a long time, allowing the ship to drift closer to the school of whales.",
  "803323": "<b>The crew embarrass themselves.</b> The underwater whales cannot hear the sounds squirming from the ship, and it's for the best. Dejected, their ears ringing, the sailors blame each other for the performance, and the team's unity and pride are deeply dented. Getting squashed by a whale would have been a better option.",
  "803324": "Send a man in the diving bell to fix the rudder",
  "803325": "<b>The sailor has rarely worked with such a view.</b> As the hours disappear while he fixes the rudder, the whales continue their inexorable advance in a vision of lethargic, yet grandiose movement.

  "803332": "<b>The diving bell's rope tightens, then floats back up.</b> Both equipment and sailor are lost to the unfathomable depths and their gigantic inhabitants. The crew ponders whether the accident was caused by chance, or animal malevolence.",
  "803335": "Fire canons in the water to scare the whales away",
  "803336": "<b>The tiny cannonballs somehow drive the massive creatures away.</b> As the sea foams and whitens under the force of the impacts, it hides what reaction the whales may have. When the froth clears, the animals seem to have dived away from the ship, but the men stay tense for a long while.",
  "803337": "<b>Ten pound cannonballs against creatures of a hundred tons?</b> A whale slams into the ship, then another one, then another. The repetitive impacts make the crew believe the attacks are intentional, and they rally into begging prayers and whimpers. When the ocean's fury recedes, they're left to count the sailors thrown overboard.",

But the rolling timbers and makeshift winches they have crafted prove adequate, and the ship finally scrapes down the other side, into the upper river. Mr. Cardinale barely offers a word of thanks, perturbed perhaps, by the indignity of it all.",

  "800326": "<b>It is all going so well,</b> this mad idea, with winches and cables scarcely sufficient for the task. But exertion eventually tells. As the ship rocks over the crest of the hill, there is not enough to keep it there, and it hurtles wildly down the other side. It is lucky the ship is not swept away in the river current. Still, it sustains significant damage from impact with the trees.",
  "800327": "<b>'I think it's going to give way!'</b> cries the terrified Mr. Cardinale. The feet of your men slip and slide on the slope, as the unholy weight of the ship overcomes the winches, and it plummets back down the hill.

When the artifact is brought back to the surface and cleaned up, it reveals a weapon of exquisite quality, embedded with unknown jewels and metals.",

  "800526": "Let there be a trial",
  "800529": "<b>The trial goes as well as can be expected.</b> The suspects are cross-examined, and proceedings recorded with quill and ink. The shoe-prints belong to a solemn old gent, whose testimony reveals him to be the midshipman's secret lover - the reason he was unforthcoming. He confirms the dead man intended suicide from guilt at their relationship, and was trying to prevent it, but arrived too late. All are grateful that the truth is finally out.",
  "800530": "<b>The trial is a farce.</b> Sailors bark questions from the sidelines which the suspects are quite within their rights to leave unanswered.

  "256999": "Archie always makes the most fuss over the smallest things…",
  "257000": "Every time I ask Archie, I fear his insides combust.",
  "257001": "The best thing is, dear old Archie never need know.",
  "257002": "When a Queen asks you to do something…",
  "257003": "I'm issuing you a royal decree.",
  "257004": "I am the Queen after all.",
  "257005": "Yes, I jolly well think you will accept.",
  "257006": "Bon Voyage, as it is the fashion to say.",
  "257007": "Well done, you have my tender affections!",
  "257008": "I think we've both earned tea and a slice of sponge cake.",
  "257009": "What a daring young one you are!",
  "257026": "What gallantry! Though not quite worth a medal.",
  "257027": "As reliable as my guards with the funny hats.",
  "257010": "I was an obstinate child, and as such can empathise.",
  "257011": "And there was I believing I'd found a loyal dachshund.",
  "257012": "Need I tell you that you desert your nation!",
  "257013": "Like my coronation, a farce from beginning to end.",
  "257014": "My father would have had your head!",
  "257015": "Don't be afraid to hurry, we are happy to wait!",
  "257016": "Queens usually like things done quickly.",
  "257017": "At least bring me some tea if nothing else!",
  "257018": "You have served your Queen well, will you serve her again?",
  "257019": "It is a trying time for the Empire, and we need you yet...",
  "257020": "Your support is a comfort we would much like to continue.",
  "257021": "Who could possibly be more important than your Queen?",
  "257022": "I have not left the Palace in haste to be denied!",
  "257023": "Have you succeeded in your mission?",
  "257024": "Has my loyal subject returned?",
  "257025": "I am told you may have something for me?",
  "257247": "I'll call upon you, subject, if I need you.",
  "257248": "There's nothing to keep you occupied here but my puppies.",
  "257249": "Dear Archie has everything under control.",
  "266839": "Oh do stop, Archie. Is this tiny fleet all I have to sink to get my island back?",
  "266840": "Who are you, to speak up without permission?",
  "266841": "So Edvard is the traitor! I certainly never authorised that silly-billy to act on my behalf. I declare the contract null and void.",
  "266842": "Then I suppose we'll not be sinking any ships today. Not even as a deterrent?",
  "266843": "Well in that case I hereby declare Prosperity returned to the Goode children—to compensate the dead father, thereby ensuring Miss Sarmento and co. are safe from this Pyrphorian nuisance.",
  "266966": "What is that tinseled marionette talking about, Archie? We are safe here, aren't we?",
  "266987": "Look at all those subjects! How enthusiastic they seem! Do you think they celebrate me, their royal highness?",
  "266988": "And you are absolutely sure this Samuel Goode was innocent?",
  "266989": "Let's heal it then, and be off.",
  "266990": "My sincerest condolences, children of Samuel. For the loss of the father you loved, and for the tragedy caused by the unfortunate actions of your uncle.",
  "266991": "For your unquestionable loyalty and bravery you shall be knighted, and bequeathed the island of Bright Sands from now and forevermore!",
  "266992": "Hahaha... Forgive me, I always laugh at funerals!",
  "267144": "But another tiresome prophet of doom, Archie. How dreary!",
  "267435": "These rebels, whoever they are, will pay the penalty for challenging my sovereignty!",
  "267449": "The time has come to take that territory back by force.",
  "267450": "Funny, ending a war over a bit of paper!",
  "267451": "I must admit, I am too fond of my sailors.",
  "267452": "I understand this means the end of a rebellion on the island, very good.",
  "267453": "So is it Isabel who is nice, or the Pyrphorians?",
  "267454": "As long as we have Prosperity back, that business with your father can be forgotten.",
  "267455": "So Edvard was the nasty one, and Samuel was the one with the dandruff?",
  "267456": "Fancy forging a signature. People can be terrible, can't they?",
  "267457": "I'm surprised that Isabel gave it back without a fight.",
  "267632": "Once built, your Court of Justice shall inaugurate a new era of peace and prosperity for Empire.",
  "267642": "This trial should be a celebration! A toast to all things civilised.",
  "267643": "I don't normally attend trials so this one must be important.",
  "267644": "You now own the highest court in the land!",
  "267645": "The Court of Justice, magnificent!",
  "267646": "Is the Court of Justice finished yet? Not quite?",
  "267647": "I can't wait to play judge and give the gavel a sharp tap!",
  "267648": "Did Archie tell you I planned to visit? I hope there's a convenient mooring for my flagship. I don't like long walks.",
  "267649": "Treat me as you would any other guest.",
  "267650": "Just so you know, I am not fond of garlic or profiteroles.",
  "267651": "One approves! And it is nice to get out and about.",
  "267652": "It all sounds very cheery so far. Make it cheerier.",
  "267653": "Mind you, I do like it when things are special. You can do special?",
  "267654": "May I express my gratitude for your sterling work preserving peace on the continent.",
  "267655": "So this is the funny little island that's hosting the trial! Jolly good.",
  "267656": "Now I'm here, I am of course impatient for the trial to begin.",
  "267657": "A modern Queen must show she is able to dispense mercy. The man must be given fair hearing.",
  "267658": "Where are all the witnesses?",
  "267659": "Now we are finally all present, let this long overdue trial commence!",
  "267660": "And where's the defendant?",
  "267772": "This is all rather unusual. We are safe here?",
  "267792": "This is unexpected. You are taking care of those beastly malefactors, aren't you?",
  "267793": "A few angry hoodlums can't overthrow an Empire, can they?",
  "267794": "I thought they must be after fame or riches, but they want to kill me.",
  "267795": "I wonder what has become of the royal fleet…",
  "267796": "Tell me they are not attacking this island? The one we are on?",
  "267797": "I surrender myself wholly to your security arrangements.",
  "267798": "I suppose then, my safety is in your hands.",
  "267800": "When we get out of this I promise you a whole duchy. Although, no, I can't actually promise that.",
  "267801": "We are so happy to be finally allowed to leave this island. And for your heroism of course.",
  "267802": "Under different circumstances, you might have called it a pleasant visit!",
  "267803": "I'm sure we can make Isabel's tiny little chunk a protectorate of some sort.",
  "259872": "It makes one feel frisky and alive!",
  "259873": "We ARE amused!",
  "259874": "This suits us very well.",
  "259875": "How wonderful to have it our own way!",
  "259876": "How mischievous one feels!",
  "259877": "It has all gone off very satisfactorily!",
  "259878": "All is much as it should be.",
  "259879": "Be strong in business, and become a pillar of our nation.",
  "259880": "You continue to be of the greatest use to us.",
  "259881": "Your successes must be a source of pride.",
  "259882": "We appreciate your efforts.",
  "259883": "Parliament commends you exceedingly.",
  "259884": "You slide easily about the board like the rook!",
  "259885": "You are a very able servant of the realm.",
  "259886": "We are not amused!",
  "259887": "The Queen regrets this distressing affair.",
  "259888": "Another Queen may have turned to execution by now.",
  "259889": "It is gravely injurious to our nation.",
  "259890": "One wants prompt action against such outrage.",
  "259891": "It is a time of discord for those of my station.",
  "259892": "One of the many threats to my position.",
  "259893": "The Queen finds your conduct inexcusable!",
  "259894": "My father would have had you executed!",
  "259895": "You WILL do better!",
  "259896": "What a perilously selfish subject you are!",
  "259897": "Your Queen is displeased with you.",
  "259898": "Parliament will discuss what shall be done with you.",
  "259899": "Tantamount to treason!",
  "257028": "If it please an all-powerful deity to place me on the throne, it shall certainly please you...",
  "257030": "I am your Queen. What further introduction is needed?",
  "257029": "Have you met Nelson? Why he's a chestnut stallion with an Arabian head.",
  "257031": "Oh pooh to 'your highness', call me ma'am.",
  "257032": "I was beginning to enjoy being alone for once.",
  "257033": "I long for some gaiety - a play or an opera.",
  "257034": "I am fond of pleasant society, are you that?",
  "257035": "No interruption fatigues, if it benefits the nation.",
  "257036": "The dogs bite traitors and loyal alike, so they aren't much help.",
  "260946": "A discretionary fleet for national emergencies.",
  "260947": "I want to be a spearhead not a figurehead.",
  "260948": "We do not solicit violence, yet under my rule it seems as constant as the crashing waves.",
  "260949": "I do not forget the sacrifice of these sailors on my account.",
  "259900": "Then we owe our gratitude.",
  "259901": "It is much admired.",
  "259902": "Sincere thanks for attending to this matter.",
  "259903": "It would be prudent to accept.",
  "259904": "Oh, we are only too happy to agree.",
  "259905": "We shall be delighted.",
  "261073": "Apparently my father disliked babies. I think I shall be as decisive, but slightly less mad.",
  "261075": "It doesn't matter what you think of me, it is what I think of you.",
  "261076": "Archie has been like a father to me, his company fills me with all those paternal hopes and comforts.",
  "261077": "Archie never stops me eating jam, and will suffer the subsequent indigestion for me too!",
  "261078": "If not for Archie, the rest would still be leading me up and down stairs like an infant.",
  "261074": "Lady Margaret Hunt, née Harlow, is a respected voice on the Royal Council.",
  "261079": "Sarmento is a strong woman, let us hope she keeps no secrets from us.",
  "261080": "Anne Harlow must know that no injustice can excuse her own crimes.",
  "261081": "Jean La Fortune is a pirate whose name I too-commonly hear.",
  "261082": "The council has agreed my prison reforms, so I hope Mr. Bleakworth will bend a little.",
  "261083": "Miss Jorgensen is a distant relative. Although all my relatives are quite distant.",
  "261084": "I understand we have visiting royalty in Princess Qing. She's a gentle soul.",
  "261085": "Willie Wibblesock? A made-up name surely?!",
  "261086": "It's Mr von Malching. I will never offer that awful man a barony.",
  "261088": "The presence of Vicente Silva is clearly an attempt by La Corona to challenge my authority here.",
  "259906": "Shame Queens can't chop heads anymore.",
  "259907": "Heaven forbid!",
  "259908": "If that is a joke, it is not a funny one.",
  "250673": "Pull up your braces, and thrust into the unknown!",
  "250674": "If you pop off now, you'll be back in time for tennis!",
  "250675": "Know that any assistance may influence Her Majesty's sphere!",
  "250676": "Alas, my bowels churn afresh and I must beg your expertise...",
  "250677": "Now here is a vital matter, of Queen and country!",
  "250680": "Righty-ho!",
  "250681": "Jolly Roger!",
  "250682": "Buckaroo!",
  "250683": "That really is first-rate.",
  "250684": "I am quite penetrated by your kindness.",
  "250685": "Bish-bang-bibbly, there she blows!",
  "250686": "Ideally, one should keep one's promises.",
  "250687": "Now, now. You oughtn't waste people's time.",
  "250688": "Didn't finish? Ah. Um…hmmn…",
  "250689": "Failed? I feel a ghastly surge coming on.",
  "250690": "Caught trousers down? Happens to the best of us!",
  "250708": "Her Majesty has little patience, I'd skip to it if I were you!",
  "250709": "Have you heard the expression, 'a stitch in time saves nine' …",
  "250710": "Resting? Perhaps you'd like my latest; male torso in rosewood!",
  "250711": "Much has moved since we spoke, but I can still count on you?",
  "250712": "I fear I must call upon you again, in spite of your good work.",
  "250713": "I confess these unseemly troubles gurgle on, hope you don't mind?",
  "250714": "Loyalty to the crown really should come above all else …",
  "250715": "Only Her Majesty has your best interests at heart.",
  "254725": "Oh, you're ready?",
  "254726": "Had a rip-roaring time of it?",
  "254727": "Brought some joy?",
  "257203": "Nothing just now, but we value your eagerness!",
  "257204": "If you return a little later, I may have something…",
  "257205": "Pop back another time, and I'll fill your stocking.",
  "257206": "Apart from security, I appreciate the company!",
  "257207": "Two's the charm!",
  "257208": "Well well, chosen for a royal escort!",
  "250435": "I'm here if ever you need a steady, albeit somewhat arthritic, hand to guide you.",
  "250436": "Sir Archibald Blake, Her Majesty's moist mouthpiece!",
  "250437": "One-piece underwear suits? Too prickly! I find singleton shorts and vests to be tried and true!",
  "250479": "Weird and wonderful!",
  "250482": "I'm sure ma'am shall be delighted!",
  "250483": "Superlative!",
  "250484": "Suitably regal!",
  "250485": "Her Majesty might approve!",
  "250486": "Comforting as a moist and springy sponge!",
  "250487": "Well that certainly settles the stomach!",
  "250489": "You're a credit to the Empire!",
  "250490": "You're constant, and that is key!",
  "250491": "Perhaps a peerage is on the cards?",
  "250492": "Majesty will soon be mentioning you.",
  "250493": "I knew you'd come through!",
  "250494": "You're flourishing!",
  "250495": "You're a national treasure!",
  "250496": "Her Majesty will be discomfited…",
  "250497": "There's an unpleasant waft in the air.",
  "250498": "Heavens, what shall I tell her majesty?",
  "250499": "Oh, horsefeathers.",
  "250500": "This brings on my indigestion.",
  "250501": "I'm suddenly hot under the collar.",
  "250502": "Pshaw, I shan't sleep at all.",
  "250503": "You put me in a difficult position…",
  "250504": "I wouldn't wish to accuse you of disloyalty…",
  "250505": "Perhaps think again on the situation?",
  "250506": "I fear you've made things awkward…",
  "250507": "Might I advise against your current course?",
  "250508": "Now we don't want to have a contretemps.",
  "250509": "It's not that we don't trust you entirely…",
  "250511": "I present my humble duty to you, and am confident you'll transcend your present circumstance!",
  "250512": "I am a humble servant of Her Majesty, called upon for delicate occasions such as these.",
  "250513": "Taking the initiative - excellent!",
  "250514": "What a jolly, jolly surprise.",
  "250515": "Ah yes, the bright young sapling!",
  "250516": "I present my humble duty to you.",
  "250517": "Don't tell me I've missed another appointment?",
  "250518": "Sir Archibald Blake, how may I serve?",
  "250519": "Anyone for croquet?",
  "250541": "We prepare for the worst but hope for the best.",
  "250542": "Our humble little Empire.",
  "250543": "The King is dead, long live the Queen!",
  "250544": "The street layout was positively Byzantine until recent times.",
  "250546": "Her Majesty's finest!",
  "250547": "A lustrous jewel in the crown!",
  "250548": "Every ship needs a stiff rudder!",
  "250549": "An Empire covers both land AND sea!",
  "250550": "Ma'am and I are much obliged!",
  "250551": "A royal acknowledgement is due!",
  "250552": "Sir Archibald gives his thanks.",
  "250553": "Naturally!",
  "250557": "But of course!",
  "250559": "Oh, most assuredly!",
  "250593": "I fear that may be impossible.",
  "250594": "The thought makes me wince!",
  "250595": "Oh my aching organs, no.",
  "250596": "As a boy, I was chased through the palace by a disgruntled goose, honking and hissing! I had its egg, you see. Once I'd given it back, the goose and I became firm friends.",
  "250597": "Tolerance, sympathy, understanding. Supreme qualities in a monarch wishing for a happy reign.",
  "250598": "Her Majesty rarely needs guidance - ah, a little here and there - I think she simply likes to have my company.",
  "250599": "Ever carved a lovespoon from walnut? I did have an amour once, but matters of state drew us apart.",
  "250600": "As Her Majesty's adjutant, I must be quietly attentive. The merest smile on her face is enough!",
  "250601": "Viscount Guffington-Hawkmoth, wounded at his own estate. It brings to light Her Majesty's very present vulnerability.",
  "250602": "Bless Her Majesty, she eats so fast, but when she stops, so must we!",
  "250605": "Her Majesty's rare gift is a soft heart and a hard mind. With monarchs, it is too often the reverse!",
  "250606": "Anne Harlow's fall from grace was stormy and unpleasant, a bit like my bowels.",
  "250607": "George Smith has a marvellous walking cane of alder, with tasteful silver flourishes.",
  "250608": "Aha...Jean La Fortune. We'd like to have helped, but it's rather gone beyond that now.",
  "250609": "Isabel Sarmento? You should probably be careful where you speak that name.",
  "250610": "Mr. Bleakworth may seem a blinkered horse, but is very well-suited to his task at the prison.",
  "250611": "When running errands for Her Majesty, I often find myself in Madame Kahina's exquisite company.",
  "250612": "Miss Jorgensen is a far relation of Her Majesty, if I'm not mistaken. They do both share a certain boldness...",
  "250613": "We have made every conceivable dispensation for Princess Qing, as we are compelled to do with visiting royalty!",
  "250614": "We auditioned this Wibblesock for Her Majesty's fifteenth birthday, sadly the rabbit didn't survive the hat.",
  "250615": "Beryl O'Mara has flies on the wall, as I only dream our own discrete services might.",
  "250616": "Her Majesty wearies of Mr. von Malching's pinguid claims to a non-existent barony.",
  "250617": "I worry Artur Gasparov might one day appear at the palace better-dressed than her majesty.",
  "250666": "Pure pleasure …",
  "250667": "All in Her Majesty's name.",
  "250668": "More flexible than you imagined!",
  "250669": "The royal seal upon it!",
  "250670": "I can finally let go that pent-up gas!",
  "250671": "Customs and excise, eh!",
  "250672": "Duty done, time for a kip!",
  "256682": "Oh dear, lost your flagship? Well, I'll see what I can rustle up...",
  "261188": "We can't deny it's a difficult time. The sale of Prosperity was highly destabilising for Her Majesty.",
  "265026": "Debt free? Spiffing, just the dib-dab. One splendid licence we shall draw up forthwith.",
  "265027": "As to the debt, my hands are tied — but it may warm her majesty's heart to see a new enterprise taking shape.",
  "265028": "Did he really…? Oh dear, best leave these poor people with me. I will tell Edvard that the debt between you is quite settled…",
  "265061": "What is it you are bringing?",
  "266751": "I will let Edvard know that I have granted you your shipping licence.",
  "266752": "We also hear on the grapevine, of your commendable intention to establish your own shipping company…",
  "266753": "Her Majesty warmly invites you to trade in sovereign harbours, at your own discretion of course.",
  "266199": "So you build ships like your father? Well, the Queen is in the direst need of ships.",
  "266200": "Supporting her will go some way to healing the wounds of the past.",
  "266201": "These reinforcements will please Her Majesty! Though it remains my hope no war will be necessary.",
  "266809": "I read in the papers you build ships like your father. His actions have likely led to war, so it would be strangely fitting if you were to supply the Queen's fleet.",
  "266810": "You are doing Her Majesty a great service in these difficult times.",
  "266811": "How are those ships coming along? Her Majesty will be pleased.",
  "266812": "Her Majesty wants only warships. It is after all important in such times that she defends her sovereignty.",
  "266813": "We rely more and more on captains of industry to steer us to happy futures.",
  "266261": "This symbol is a death threat?! But Her Majesty received one identical! Upon a plain envelope, with a stamp from the colonies!",
  "266262": "We still don't know how your father was involved in all this, but I fear the answer lies west.",
  "266263": "Your father sold Prosperity to the leader of the rebels Isabel Sarmento.",
  "266933": "The sale of Prosperity, made in Samuel's name, has weakened Her Majesty's position greatly.",
  "266264": "Ever since the deal, Isabel has been hiding from us. But you may be the one to find her.",
  "266926": "After the excellent work you are doing for the fleet, I think you're entitled to pursue the odd personal matter.",
  "266931": "I wish as much as you that your father were innocent in this.",
  "266932": "Those very serious accusations against your father are hard to dismiss without proof to the contrary.",
  "266934": "You digging around in state matters isn’t ideal, but in this case may be necessary.",
  "266935": "That these ''Pyrphorians'' may have spread their influence in the New World is grave news indeed.",
  "266936": "The situation closer to home is already difficult. Her Majesty has come under increasing scrutiny from many sides.",
  "266937": "Her Majesty may go to war with Isabel. That is why she is mustering a fleet.",
  "266938": "Isabel will be cagey, but I think she with time may listen to us.",
  "266939": "Isabel may not trust you to begin with. But remember, neither did I!",
  "266940": "You may find Isabel fiercely independent. But I trust in you to bring her round.",
  "266941": "I fear Her Majesty will not care to know the difference between these Pyrphorians and the local rebellion. So we'll have to leave that to you.",
  "266942": "I wish you the best, for Queen and country!",
  "268092": "Her Majesty is on edge. You'd better keep things ticking along with Isabel.",
  "268091": "However Prosperity fell into the wrong hands, it really needs to be set right before Her Majesty sends the fleet.",
  "268090": "The Queen really is ready to do something drastic. We don't have a lot of leeway.",
  "268089": "Do not underestimate the efficiency of the Pyrphorian machine. Wheels no doubt turn turn as we speak.",
  "268088": "Her Majesty wants Prosperity back. By whatever means necessary...",
  "268087": "Prosperity was our key to unlock the region. The Empire stands to lose greatly from that deal.",
  "268086": "We have little influence in new world waters now, you are the one diplomatic weapon we have.",
  "268085": "Most of us want a peaceful conclusion from this Prosperity business.",
  "267367": "Her Majesty will soon go to war with Isabel over Prosperity. Any other solution would be preferable.",
  "267389": "You would be doing a great service for Queen and country.",
  "267390": "With that document we can still reverse the original deal.",
  "267391": "Then it was Edvard that sold Prosperity. I didn't want to believe it, but I had my suspicions.",
  "267392": "Her Majesty is very quick on the trigger. We must some how avoid her coming to blows.",
  "267393": "Her Majesty will soon arrive upon her charger, sword aloft.",
  "267394": "You have averted war most delicately! Her Majesty may thank you, in time.",
  "267395": "Good, but there's little time. Her Majesty has her campaign chart out on the table!",
  "267396": "A whole nation is behind you, though they do not know it.",
  "267397": "Our Empire is spread too thin to countenance another war at this time.",
  "267398": "Now war has been averted, an alliance with Isabel might even be of mutual benefit…",
  "267399": "With the Pyrphorian presence on Prosperity neutralised, the island can be freely returned to its rightful keeper.",
  "267400": "The Pyrphorians will no doubt regroup elsewhere.",
  "267401": "Isabel needn't be an enemy to us, now Prosperity is back in safe hands.",
  "267605": "I think it's better you break the bad news to Edvard. Let him know his gambit is over.",
  "267619": "A terrible business. Edvard must be put now to trial.",
  "267620": "It has been decided that you shall construct a new Court of Justice for the purpose of Edvard's trial.",
  "267621": "As saviour in the New World, Her Majesty agrees that you should host this prestigious trial.",
  "267622": "It is fitting that a new crown court be erected upon family soil for the trial.",
  "267623": "Just like your court of justice, the case against Edvard is beginning to gather momentum.",
  "267624": "Her Majesty has been ever so much looking forward to seeing her new Court of Justice. I hope you'll be ready.",
  "267625": "Her Majesty is itching to visit! Have your best curtsey ready!",
  "267626": "I hardly dare interrupt the miraculous transformation of your island, but Her Majesty is rather keen to get on with things.",
  "267627": "This could be a good opportunity for Isabel Sarmento to come forward as a witness.",
  "267628": "I think we have built up enough trust with Isabel to rely on her as a witness.",
  "267629": "Her majesty was remarkably tolerant of the idea of Sarmento as a witness.",
  "267630": "When it comes to the Pyrphorians, there's still a lot we don't know.",
  "267631": "The Queen has taken a great interest in this trial.",
  "267805": "The Pyrphorians must fall or civilisation will!",
  "267819": "Under no circumstances must the Queen's safety be compromised!",
  "267820": "You have won the day!",
  "267821": "How shall I explain to her majesty that we are under siege…",
  "267822": "This must be the Pyrphorian mothership!",
  "267823": "My giddy aunt, that is no normal naval craft!",
  "267824": "Without supplies, I'm not absolutely sure we can hold out…",
  "267825": "The Queen must be saved at all costs!",
  "267826": "Those supplies could be crucial in gaining the upper hand over our foes.",
  "267827": "Reinforcements are coming! Our royal supply ships must pass unscathed!",
  "267828": "We cannot afford to lose many more ships to our foe.",
  "267829": "Perhaps this will bring their ringleader out of the woodwork.",
  "267830": "Such reinforcements are going to be vital.",
  "267831": "The Queen is saved! All thanks to your remarkable travails and hardships!",
  "267832": "The battle for Bright Sands will decide the fate of civilisation!",
  "267833": "The ever-increasing roar from the street will need a ruler as capable and wise as Her Majesty.",
  "266722": "Abduction is a severe accusation...",
  "266723": "I see nothing criminal. A bit of interfamilial bickering is only natural, and hardly a matter for the crown.",
  "266724": "And as for you, I have quite forgotten my manners. Sir Archibald Blake, ambassador and confidant to the Queen. Despite the circumstances, Her Majesty and I were pleased to hear of your return. Your father’s death was a tragedy; we regret he never had the chance of a fair trial.",
  "266725": "Sadly your Uncle has indeed alerted me to some floating liabilities. I fear you have no choice but to settle them if I am to grant you your crown shipping licence.",
  "266849": "Isabel Sarmento, Her Royal Highness The Queen requires you to give up your iniquitous seizure of Prosperity, an island which, by no means...",
  "266850": "Er… this is one of the Goode children I mentioned. A little forward, but surprisingly helpful so far!",
  "266851": "Terribly sorry, your Majesty, but I fear not.",
  "266971": "As safe as the situation allows, highness.",
  "266972": "Oh you are awfully right, old chum. I beseech you, we must protect Her Majesty at any cost!",
  "266993": "In a manner of speaking, your Majesty, in a manner of speaking!",
  "266994": "No doubt, your Majesty—mustn't worry. Your attendance at this ceremony is nothing short of sublime. A gesture of the uttermost nobility that can heal this tormented place.",
  "266995": "I fear Majesty, it is time we were on our way...",
  "267145": "Well, momentarily, at least! Mr. Edvard Goode, you are to be placed under house arrest in Bright Sands until the time of your trial.",
  "266482": "Oh… there’s already someone out there!",
  "266483": "How do you look? I’d presumed we would be fully rendered here…",
  "266484": "Darnation! I always said this union business was a nonsense! And that we are to look shabby-chic because of it?! Whatever next, my dear Tanya? Shall we abandon it all?",
  "266485": "Not \"Anno 1800 - The Musical\", then?!'",
  "266486": "Er...I’m not sure if her Majesty would approve. Perhaps over tea at the palace we could discuss your designs and—",
  "266487": "Oh dear Tanya, please can we stick to…",
  "266488": "Equally as flat as you are.",
  "266489": "But we are not in private! You are here in the role of Anno-A.I! Carl Leonard von Malching—ill-tempered industrialist!",
  "266490": "One moment, her majesty has not arrived yet.",
  "266491": "quite feeble and small",
  "266492": "The magic lies in the checksum",
  "266493": "We could never have dared hope you would participate in so irreverent a trifle.",
  "266494": "To be honest, no…",
  "266495": "No!",
  "266496": "But the game is jolly boring. Half the time I’m asleep before anyone discovers my island!",
  "266497": "When your ship has you snoring / When the waiting is boring / I click fast forward!",
  "266498": "Is my island warehouse bare? / Is that just too hard to bear? / then I fast forward!",
  "266499": "Simply just fast forward!",
  "266500": "We fast forward, and forward…",
  "266501": "I think the sun is burned-out.",
  "266502": "You don’t recognise it? I jest not, this is how we looked in 1602.",
  "266503": "Oh so true! It’s far too much blue!",
  "266504": "Oh horror! Oh pain! / Who came up with this stupid play!?",
  "266505": "All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?",
  "266506": "Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.",
  "255457": "Buck up ye giant squid …I promise I won't tell.",
  "255458": "Let's see what you're good for, shall we?",
  "255459": "I'll put you on trial, but be ready for the noose.",
  "255461": "Ready to take a walk, sailor?",
  "255460": "I've a part for you in my tragedy.",
  "255462": "And cut a few throats on the way.",
  "255463": "Brave. Very brave.",
  "255464": "Shake the tree, see what falls.",
  "255465": "You shall have a share, just like the rest of us.",
  "255466": "Now we all get a piece.",
  "255467": "Got away with it, this time.",
  "255470": "None shall live who scorn the oath.",
  "255471": "You're dead, milksop.",
  "255472": "No prey, no pay.",
  "255473": "The black spot be upon yer.",
  "255474": "I don't forgive or forget.",
  "255475": "I'll stick a breech-loader in yer breeches!",
  "255476": "Fly the flag, or the flintlock goes up you.",
  "255477": "Don't think you can hide ashore.",
  "255478": "Climb back in the cannon lunkhead, the fuse is already lit!",
  "255479": "Keep swimming, or you'll drown.",
  "255480": "Hold out yer glass, lightweight.",
  "255481": "Show you ain't a rotten royalist.",
  "255482": "I guarantee you'll be fish bait.",
  "255483": "Ready for your share?",
  "255484": "Found yer prey?",
  "255485": "Done the deed, have yer?",
  "257212": "Not yet! Watch for the sign.",
  "257213": "Only come here when I need you or you'll regret it.",
  "257214": "I don't need your help.",
  "257215": "Prove yer worth at sea.",
  "257216": "Let's see what kind of landlubber we have eh boys?",
  "257217": "Let's see if yer talk's as good as yer walk.",
  "261180": "My father gave his life to his king. Your father gave his life to his Queen. Still they're never sated.",
  "261181": "You'd fight the crown if you knew the truth, not crawl beneath it.",
  "267923": "When it comes to murder, all roads lead to Rome.",
  "267924": "So, you're the Queen's errand boy.",
  "261182": "Say hello to my old mate Jean, won't yer?",
  "261183": "My father never had the privilege of a trial. Your Queen's father near strung him up himself.",
  "266596": "Why does everyone want a piece of the Queen now?",
  "266597": "I'm sure I recognised something about that grandmaster.",
  "258453": "Piracy's not dead then, not while Angry Annie's men lurk abroad.",
  "258454": "Don't you dare smile, or I'll cut you a new one.",
  "258455": "I give the orders matey, or you lose your coconut.",
  "258456": "Death to the Queen!",
  "258457": "Raise the Corsair cloth!",
  "258458": "A rusty nail in the enemy's socket.",
  "258459": "Three cheers for vengeance!",
  "258460": "Disobey's a pretty way!",
  "258461": "Soon they'll have nothing left.",
  "258462": "No-one slights a Harlow.",
  "258463": "I like people with a coarse air.",
  "258464": "Lucky you, still with a head!",
  "258465": "Should I scrub that mark from your name.",
  "258466": "Aren't we a pair of pitiful souls.",
  "258467": "I'd hang you. Take that as a compliment.",
  "258468": "At least you're a bit rough round the fringes.",
  "258469": "I'd almost believe you weren't a royalist.",
  "258470": "For every head lost, I'll take ten more!",
  "258471": "If I don't have my way, no-one else has theirs.",
  "258472": "Life pricks us, do we not bleed?!",
  "258473": "So what if I keep my own wounds green?",
  "258474": "Hate is a bottomless cup that I pour and pour.",
  "258475": "I'll die if that's what it takes.",
  "258476": "Nothing can make it any worse…",
  "258477": "Get in my way again, and I'll skewer you.",
  "258478": "I'll strip out yer gizzard.",
  "258479": "D'you take me for some dime novel damsel?!",
  "258480": "I've got no problem slitting yer belly.",
  "258481": "I've n'er seen flippers so limp as yours!",
  "258482": "We'll spoon out your goggles like cockles.",
  "258483": "We'll crush yer bones like hardtack biscuits.",
  "255394": "Shake yer booty out of Angry Annie's waters or she'll blow a hole in yer mizzen.",
  "255395": "Know what Annie does with royalists? We dunk you full o' fish.",
  "256852": "If yer be no pirate, yer be prey.",
  "256870": "Better hope you can hold yer own with a rapier.",
  "256871": "Now why would you come 'ere?",
  "256872": "So ye know, there'll be no stopping vengeance!",
  "256873": "This one thinks they're a pirate lads.",
  "256874": "You'll take a drop o' powder in your liquor.",
  "256875": "I'll drink you under the table!",
  "260906": "I'd rather count heads than have four-poster beds.",
  "260907": "I don't need to dress like Pope Joan to rule these reprobates.",
  "260908": "Yeah life here's miserable, spare me the requiem.",
  "260909": "Father'd've hated to see me live like this, but I don't care.",
  "260910": "Yeah, I stole this ship. Start as you mean to go on!",
  "260911": "No coward man is Annie's match at sea.",
  "260912": "The ship it was their coffin, and their grave it was the sea",
  "260913": "We pirates may not rule the waves, but we make them bloody choppy.",
  "258484": "Expect me to be grateful?",
  "258485": "Nothing can bring my father back.",
  "258486": "What have I got to be thankful for?",
  "258487": "Aye.",
  "258488": "On their heads be it.",
  "258489": "That's right and proper.",
  "261001": "Proud to be exactly what my father wasn't - a traitor! God save the Queen!",
  "261002": "A thousand privateers who would die to live, and me, who lives only to die.",
  "261003": "We are wronged, all of us. The Empire shall feel the wrath of scimitar, spear and cutlass!",
  "261004": "My whole house gone to hell, but for I, the last swish of its flaming tail.",
  "261005": "If execution was good enough for my brother, it'll be good enough for Her Majesty.",
  "261006": "Any pirate not flying my flag is a dead man - you hear me La Fortune?!",
  "261007": "Even I don't completely hate Bente.",
  "261012": "If Aunt Maggie won't fight tooth and nail for our blood, then I'll have to go it alone.",
  "261008": "Aunt Maggie doesn't approve of barefaced vengeance.",
  "261009": "I'll jam the crown down over her ears, for my father 'Ben Harlow!'",
  "261010": "I'll rip off Blake's toupee, and make him eat it like a dog.",
  "261011": "Graves has it right, only death can wash away the pain!",
  "255583": "Shouldda prised it from yer cold dead hands.",
  "255584": "That's the going price for contraband.",
  "255585": "Now to smuggle it out.",
  "255586": "Share it out boys.",
  "255587": "Are you kind, or blind?",
  "255588": "No such thing as fair trade.",
  "255589": "Mine by right anyway.",
  "256931": "Shouldda prised it from yer cold dead hands.",
  "256930": "That's the going price for contraband.",
  "256929": "Now to smuggle it out.",
  "258490": "Ho-ho, no.",
  "258491": "I'd rather die.",
  "258492": "Over my dead body!",
  "256327": "You'll take it, if you know what's good fer yer.",
  "256334": "I'd be biting off my hand.",
  "256335": "Here's yer share.",
  "256336": "Raise the black flag boys!",
  "256337": "Ever deal with a pirate?",
  "256338": "Have a heart-to-heart shall we?",
  "256339": "I'm not here for the chatter.",
  "256328": "My little fishes want feeding.",
  "256340": "I can't wait to scratch out yer eyes.",
  "256341": "Perhaps its time you met our Davy Jones?",
  "256342": "If it's a fight you want, a fight ye shall 'ave.",
  "256329": "I've no quarrel with it.",
  "256343": "It'll have to do.",
  "256344": "Seems fair.",
  "256345": "Well, blow me down!",
  "256346": "Fine, but it don't make yer a sea dog.",
  "256130": "Trying to pull our legs?",
  "256147": "No deal, dog.",
  "256148": "I've made better deals with seals.",
  "256149": "We pirates don't barter.",
  "256150": "I'd rather kiss a monkey's dungbie.",
  "256131": "Stop yer blubber, lubber.",
  "256151": "Arrgh, leave me be.",
  "256152": "Why talk when we could brawl?",
  "256153": "Batten yer mouth or I will.",
  "256154": "Shut yer gills!",
  "256330": "Think you got us over a barrel?",
  "256347": "You'll have to vie for it.",
  "256348": "Not unless we get what's ours.",
  "256349": "You haven't seen the last of us!",
  "256350": "You'll pay for this.",
  "256351": "We'll only take it out on someone else.",
  "256352": "We'll never yield to a bluejacket.",
  "256353": "What have we got to lose?",
  "256354": "But, we're dead already.",
  "256355": "I've thrown you a ladder.",
  "256356": "You were saved by the code.",
  "256357": "Profit apiece.",
  "256358": "A pirate blessing.",
  "256359": "Better than a kick to the rigging.",
  "256360": "Walk the board!",
  "256361": "No quarter!",
  "256362": "Have some, fishface.",
  "256363": "A shot across yer bows.",
  "256364": "How are yer sea legs?",
  "257968": "Here's an easy target lads.",
  "257970": "You look like a royalist, that's enough for us.",
  "257971": "Prepare to be boarded.",
  "257969": "Count yerself lucky, yer pimple.",
  "257972": "And they say Annie has no mercy...",
  "258508": "None of that pity, just the laying down of arms.",
  "258509": "I don't expect you'll show mercy.",
  "258523": "Don't waste yer effort, we're dead already.",
  "258510": "Trade us in, and we'll box you good and proper.",
  "258511": "We pirates have special terms.",
  "258512": "Willing to pay the price?",
  "258513": "From now on, you'll stay away, d'yer hear?",
  "258514": "Deal with my men again and I'll cut you a smile.",
  "258515": "Haven't you heard? Pirates never barter!",
  "258516": "Not 'cos we want to, 'cos we have to.",
  "258517": "On one condition; you're still not a pirate.",
  "258518": "Finally got you off our backs.",
  "258519": "Good news, we don't need you any more.",
  "258520": "Don't think you'll be getting any more.",
  "258521": "This is an exception!",
  "258522": "We'll have it back soon enough.",
  "256365": "Blimey.",
  "256370": "Ho!",
  "256371": "Sink me!",
  "256372": "Ye old Sturgeon!",
  "256373": "Thinks like one of us!",
  "256374": "Bluejacket.",
  "256375": "Bilgewater.",
  "256376": "You and yer long clothes.",
  "256377": "Arrrgh!",
  "256378": "Belay that blunder!",
  "257973": "Think you can harm what's already dead!",
  "257974": "Oh we're prepared to fight to the death.",
  "257975": "Ere, this little fish has come to us!",
  "257976": "I don't need telling enough's enough!",
  "257977": "Fine, but stay out of our way.",
  "258493": "It's rare we leave any alive.",
  "258494": "Call that a storm, why it was nothing at all!",
  "258495": "Fine, but I decide where we meet.",
  "258496": "Smuggling? What of it...?",
  "258497": "We usually meet by the light of the moon.",
  "258498": "That just makes you fair game again, right boys?",
  "258499": "Whatsay we come for your goods just the same?",
  "258500": "Makes no odds to us how you want to be stung.",
  "258501": "A fellow outcast eh? I'll be the judge of that.",
  "258502": "Ye'll never last with ol' Annie.",
  "258503": "I knew you wouldn't stick it with us for long.",
  "258504": "We prefer our own company anyway.",
  "257978": "Because everyone knows pirates like doubloons.",
  "257979": "Fine, we'll top up the 'old sea chest'.",
  "257980": "That's the funniest thing I've heard in forever.",
  "257988": "Just when I thought all comedy had died with my family.",
  "257989": "You might just be the only person angrier than me.",
  "257990": "Your acting's pretty convincing, got any tips?",
  "257981": "Tough as nails, you say? But I've got a handful of pretty tough nails right here...",
  "257991": "Ra-ra-rah' you big toff. Take yer society repartee and stick it up yer blunderbuss.",
  "257992": "Oh and while we're there, why not invite me and the horde for afternoon tea?",
  "257993": "How wonderful, you've taken pity on us.",
  "257982": "It's not from a toy box, this outfit is genuine!",
  "257995": "I was born to be a pirate, and you'll swear on your head to tell no other tale!",
  "257996": "Lies! There's nothing left of the old me!",
  "257997": "There'll be no-one to mourn you either, once I'm finished killing!",
  "257983": "A true pirate? I've heard worse about me than that.",
  "257998": "Volatile, Vengeful, Vicious? Yeah... sounds like me.",
  "257999": "Aye. The bigwigs have the weapons, but only we know how to slash 'em!",
  "258000": "Aye, maybe there was good in me once, then it died overnight.",
  "254794": "In another life, we might have been cronies.",
  "256379": "Still spring in our cable.",
  "256380": "They best leave us alone, eh?",
  "256381": "S'pose I could hate you more.",
  "256382": "Looks like the rope's got us tied.",
  "256383": "Why do I always come about to you?",
  "256384": "At least you've a few rough edges.",
  "256385": "I've been known to spare the odd cove.",
  "256386": "There's no forgiving, never!",
  "256387": "Only a fool loosens their grip.",
  "256388": "I have this nagging feeling you're a jellyfish.",
  "256389": "We don't need you dragging us down.",
  "256390": "You'll always be a goodie-goodie.",
  "256391": "I reckon I could make you cry like a wee bairn.",
  "256392": "You'd only weigh me to the bottom.",
  "256393": "Deep down I know you're a tattle-tale.",
  "265634": "We aren't friends, we're allies.",
  "265635": "Us against the world!",
  "265637": "Your politics sicken me.",
  "265638": "You lot and your etiquette.",
  "265640": "I stick by my recruits you know.",
  "265641": "Yer a real dog, aren't ya?",
  "265643": "Harsh! I like that!",
  "265644": "An enemy's enemy and all that.",
  "265636": "You don't want to mess with Anne's mates.",
  "265642": "Come for me next then, and I'll nut yer.",
  "265639": "We like a traitor.",
  "265645": "Skulduggery is second nature to us.",
  "256062": "Wi' a wannion!",
  "256080": "Vengeance!",
  "256081": "Arrrgghh!",
  "256082": "Memento mori!",
  "256083": "Oh, this is personal!",
  "256063": "Won't get me alive!",
  "268018": "We got company, boys!",
  "268019": "I can't fight as well as any!",

  "261512": "I'll smash something of yours soon enough.",
  "256069": "Now you know what it's like to have lost everything and everyone.",
  "256071": "I didn't need them, I don't need anyone.",
  "268022": "They meant nothing to me!",
  "256072": "Now kill the rest of them!",
  "268023": "We'll be drinking to death tonight!",
  "256073": "Found a uniform in the toy box have yer?",
  "256089": "If fighting's all we have, then bring it on!",

  "256092": "Nobody trifles with Annie Harlow.",
  "256093": "You don't know the sharp end of a cutlass!",
  "256094": "Got something to say to me, then say it!",
  "256075": "Going back on our promise wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.",
  "261514": "I'd rather fight without you, but we had an agreement.",

  "255511": "May as well flip a coin for it.",
  "255512": "Show me what you have.",
  "255513": "Let me see your hand.",
  "255514": "Has my boat come in?",
  "257218": "Now's not a good time.",
  "257219": "I can't work with you right now.",
  "257220": "If I had something I'd give it to you.",
  "257221": "I'm going to have to ask for your help.",
  "257222": "I smell trouble on the high seas.",
  "257223": "Normally we go it alone, but…",
  "258524": "Then a tiny independent nation rises proudly above the sea of injustice.",
  "258525": "I'd gamble on me too, there's a bet I know I can't lose.",
  "258526": "Then the die is cast. Our people have everything to fight for.",
  "258527": "Better keep a poker face.",
  "258528": "Bondye Bon.",

  "258537": "Look at you swagger!",
  "258538": "I know you must be a libertarian deep down.",
  "258539": "It's easy to get drawn in by you.",
  "258540": "Are you finally embracing a just cause?",
  "258541": "Things are hard enough as it is!",
  "258542": "What am I going to tell my wife and daughter?",
  "258543": "We don't need any more misfortune!",

  "258549": "You know, I scarcely need agitating.",
  "258550": "So snake eyes, is that how it is?",
  "258551": "Always did have you down as a despot.",
  "258552": "What have you done?!",
  "258553": "I'd hate to punish you, but if that's what it takes.",
  "258554": "I've tried everything with you…",
  "255396": "La Fortune. Play fair, we'll get along. Play foul, and I'll get along without you.",

  "261017": "I'm pretty good at talking my way out, but I rarely get that luxury.",
  "261018": "If we're such small fish, why can't they just let us swim?",
  "261020": "I'm sure the Empire's just as bad as La Corona. Of course, I wouldn't tell Her Majesty that!",

  "258572": "Oh, are we still fighting?",
  "258573": "This should be a land of free and fair trade.",
  "258574": "You can't afford to miss opportunities here.",
  "258575": "We will be a respected trading nation like the rest.",
  "258576": "Our terms of trade were a joke from the beginning.",
  "258577": "There's no benefit to us in working with you.",
  "258578": "We've got our own economy now.",

  "258583": "A token of my people's good will.",
  "258584": "Share and share alike, I say.",
  "258585": "What can I say, I'm the giving type.",
  "256430": "Now that has promise.",
  "256432": "Looking good.",
  "256433": "A fine idea!",

  "256437": "What rules were we playing?",
  "256438": "Tell me you're joking.",
  "256439": "Now that's just unfriendly.",
  "258006": "So, it's like that?",
  "258008": "Come get us, we're not afraid.",
  "258009": "We're ready for you.",
  "258007": "I can't say I'm not relieved.",

  "258587": "You're right, we need some perspective.",
  "258588": "I also have my wife and children to think about.",
  "258589": "Of course, we're always interested in commerce.",
  "258590": "Well why wouldn't you trade with us?",
  "258591": "What could possibly go wrong!",
  "258592": "It's ok, we don't have to deal.",
  "258593": "Strike out alone, I won't be a hypocrite.",
  "258594": "Maybe its better we do our own thing.",
  "258595": "I look forward to working with you.",
  "258596": "An alliance built to last.",
  "258597": "We all have our reasons, don't let me stop you.",
  "258598": "No need to apologise, I understand.",

  "258033": "Vile or not, those weapons grant us our freedom.",
  "257985": "Dapper? I've got more important things to think about than frills and silks.",
  "258034": "Don't you think I know a gallant from a shark by now?",
  "258035": "Spin your wheel somewhere else, friend, I do not exist to be played.",
  "258036": "Put a coin in and see what comes out? Non, you'll get no change from me.",
  "257986": "Might as well give up? We don't have to listen to this.",
  "258037": "Mock all you want, but we will come through this a free people.",
  "258038": "A coward?! Now I'm insulted.",
  "258039": "There's only one side I'm fighting for; the one my wife and child are on.",
  "257987": "I don't know if I'm a good father, but she and mama are safe, that's what's important.",
  "258040": "I pride myself on that good grace, no matter the...circumstances.",
  "258041": "A good sport? I am always that - lucky for you!",
  "258042": "A champion of civil rights? I hope so, I hope so.",
  "256440": "You could be the joker in this pack.",
  "256441": "When it's down to me and you, let's not fight!",
  "256442": "I don't need a quarrel with you.",
  "256443": "If I had to back a cockerel, it might be you.",
  "256444": "We don't have to live at odds.",
  "256445": "I'm not going to say I trust you.",
  "256446": "Do I really have conviction in you?",
  "256447": "Something about you still gives my people hope.",
  "256448": "Dealing with you could be a lottery.",
  "256449": "Little fish are careful who they swim with.",
  "256450": "Don't trust me?! It's the other way around.",
  "256451": "I have to think what's best for us.",
  "256452": "I have you down as a worry.",
  "256453": "We like to think independently.",
  "256454": "I better watch what I say.",
  "256455": "Experience can teach a person a lot.",
  "265646": "There are not many I can call friends.",

  "265649": "Hypocrisy is the only language the privileged speak.",
  "265650": "Are you done kissing their feet?",
  "265652": "Do you need a lesson in manners from a pirate?",
  "265653": "Well, that was rude.",
  "265655": "I bet that will sting for days.",
  "265656": "Wish I could have seen their face.",
  "265648": "Hey, I'll play the trickster around here…",
  "265654": "At least try to keep your cards close to your chest!",
  "265651": "Now that is a very clever thing indeed!",
  "265657": "Please, don't let me stop you!",
  "256097": "Sorry but we're desperate.",
  "256098": "My rules now.",
  "256099": "Let's play dice.",
  "256100": "It's easier if you don’t fight!",
  "256101": "My people need this.",
  "256102": "So, it's come to this.",
  "268010": "I will protect my family.",
  "268011": "You didn't have to do this.",
  "268012": "We've survived worse.",
  "268013": "Why us?",
  "256103": "Someone had to take the fall.",
  "256104": "Could have been anyone...",
  "256105": "Your luck's not in.",
  "256106": "Not the first gamble that didn't pay.",
  "256107": "They are good swimmers.",
  "256108": "It was worth a shot!",
  "256109": "It was begging to be knocked down.",
  "256110": "Can you blame me?",
  "256111": "You have to learn to manage your anger!",
  "261520": "Come on, that's an inanimate object!",
  "256112": "I'm sorry it had to be this way, but fish have to eat if they want to avoid being eaten.",
  "256113": "A tragic loss…",
  "268014": "They will be missed…",
  "256114": "You shield us like a cloak.",
  "268015": "You've shaken off quite a hindrance.",
  "256115": "Got to keep your options open.",
  "256116": "Everybody needs some kind of protection.",
  "256117": "We all have something to preserve.",
  "256118": "Please - you have a duty to your people.",
  "256119": "Raising the stakes, eh?",
  "256120": "I see your cards, and you don't have much.",
  "256121": "You think I'm worried?",
  "256122": "I thought you were above that.",
  "256123": "Our whole plan depends on you still being with us.",
  "261521": "Will you protect me and my family as you said you would?",
  "261527": "We are at war with your ally, let us see your true colours.",
  "256124": "Of course friend, whatever you need.",
  "261522": "It is a big risk for us, but oui, we will fight for you.",
  "256125": "They take up arms for the freedom of their colour.",
  "261523": "They pray morning and evening this war will end.",
  "261524": "We desire only to defend these properties and the families that inhabit them.",
  "256126": "You found one ship, but others are on the move.",
  "261525": "War is bad for you, we have allies everywhere.",
  "261526": "They'll lay down arms the moment you make a fair peace offer.",
  "256127": "We'll only come back stronger.",
  "256128": "As old dreams die, new ones take shape.",
  "256129": "Don't worry, we'll hide out as long as we need to.",

  "256947": "Tell no-one.",
  "256948": "Go, I trust you.",
  "256949": "Without you, I don't know what we would have done.",
  "256950": "One step closer to freedom.",
  "256951": "You make it look easy!",
  "256952": "You have done a beautiful thing this day.",
  "256953": "Your brave actions may just have saved us.",
  "256954": "Tell me, did they get to you?",
  "256955": "Any way the wind blows, eh? We will be better without you.",
  "256956": "The hopes of a generation, crushed.",
  "256957": "Do you mean to sabotage us?",
  "256958": "Not all will last in the struggle.",
  "256959": "Do not turn your back on this fight!",
  "256960": "There is a time for waiting, it is not now!",
  "256961": "Do it now, while the moon lights the river.",
  "256962": "This struggle, it is never over.",
  "256963": "Still with us?",
  "256964": "Freedom is so close, help us push through.",
  "256965": "It is in all of us to support the underdog.",
  "256966": "Don't be a fool, listen to your heart.",
  "256967": "Tell me it's good news?",
  "256968": "Did it go as planned?",
  "256969": "Every second counts.",
  "257224": "What I have would take too long to explain…",
  "257225": "I must plan our next move.",
  "257226": "Better keep our heads down for a while.",
  "257227": "Ride with us, be ready.",
  "257228": "Look after my people, they are all I have.",
  "257229": "We must protect the vulnerable who cross the seas.",
  "266735": "So, you found us. Take a look around. What can the henchmen of the Empire do to us that the Pyrphorians haven't already?",
  "266737": "Goode? The man that sold Her Majesty's precious island to me? He is just as guilty as I am!",
  "266738": "So you are calling me a liar? Love is blind. Back before they left their fiery mark, the Pyrphorians told me your father would come— to sell me Prosperity.",
  "266739": "I knew conspiring against the Empire was a bad idea. Afterwards, when I refused to work with the Pyrphorians, they came to teach us a lesson.",
  "266740": "Now our movement drills their oil for nothing, night and day. We have lost the strength to fight.",
  "266741": "Still we are afraid. And even though we buried the dead and found a hideaway, I cannot provide shelter for all of them.",
  "266742": "So you won't let go? Then let's get to business. Help me shelter and protect the good people that are part of this movement. If I see you can be trusted, I will find you the contract that sealed the deal on Prosperity. Are you in?",
  "266853": "Then we too were betrayed. We will leave Prosperity immediately, your Majesty.",
  "266854": "They are more than a nuisance! And they will never accept this. You must be careful!",
  "267070": "Build us a haven on La Isla, and we can talk about getting you that contract.",
  "267075": "We will help you. But first you have to help us.",
  "267076": "The Pyrphorians would only exploit us if we tried to resettle ourselves. But with an island under your flag…",
  "267077": "This place is more than good enough for us. We are used to living on very little.",
  "267078": "They are mostly just civilians, hoping for somewhere they can feel safe.",
  "267079": "This can be our fortress. A beautiful garden away from terrible things. We must protect it.",
  "267080": "Once this is over I promise to repay you. Right now, I care about my people's safety!",
  "267081": "We must be ready for the Pyrphorians if they come.",
  "267082": "You could make the resistance yet! We are grateful to have such security now.",
  "267083": "You're doing amazing work. Together we will fight them with everything we have!",
  "267084": "Now you can focus on La Isla. Securing the future of men, women, and children!",
  "267085": "Prosperity has been nothing but trouble for us. Go see for yourself.",
  "267086": "My followers on that island are living in fear!",
  "267087": "The persecuted, the diaspora, flock to La Isla. We must shelter them.",
  "267088": "We need to be able to hold out should the Pyrphorians strike. Anything you can provide will help.",
  "267089": "I feel bad for asking. But these people come here pockets empty.",
  "267090": "This place, La Isla, can be a fortress of salvation to these people.",
  "267091": "I didn't know if I could trust you. But you have given these people hope, and a future.",
  "267092": "We must get the people what they need, before the Pyrphorians can break our supply lines.",
  "267093": "Your father was guilty. I was with him when he signed the contract.",
  "267094": "I wouldn't be surprised if the Pyrphorians pressured your father too.",
  "267095": "The Pyrphorians took Prosperity from us the moment that deal was signed.",
  "267096": "Helping you is too risky right now. My people need shelter from the Pyrphorian menace.",
  "267097": "We had no choice. The Pyrphorians coerced us into buying Prosperity from your father.",
  "267098": "Prosperity is so rich in natural resources. No wonder it is the source of all this conflict.",
  "267099": "We want to forge something new, break away from the old.",
  "267100": "I trust your Empire no more than the Pyrphorians. We are just pawns in their game.",
  "267101": "Break free of La Corona, only to land in the lap of these Pyrphorian devils.",
  "267102": "They will torch the whole city, if you try to meddle. I suggest setting up routine patrols!",
  "267103": "Then the fires begin. It is their warning. You must find these masks who walk with the devil!",
  "267104": "The scars the fire leaves behind do not heal fast.",
  "267105": "We need a dedicated team to police the arsonists.",
  "267106": "I don't think your sister likes me. But I have to keep fighting for what I believe in.",
  "267107": "With your patrols, we can catch the arsonists in the act.",
  "267108": "Catch the Pyrphorian arsonists!",
  "267109": "It is these arsonists’ turn to be afraid!",
  "267110": "The Pyrphorians work the weak to collapse. La Isla is their only hope of recovery.",
  "267111": "Have sympathy for the many who are sick. Exhausted from the mines and the oil pumps.",
  "267112": "There are many who struggle even to walk, cruelly made to work.",
  "267113": "This is becoming a crisis. I worry the sick will die if we do not give them beds and clean linen.",
  "267114": "Their homes were taken from them. Help them dream again.",
  "267115": "First La Corona, now the Pyrphorians. If we come through this with our lives, we'll be lucky.",
  "267116": "Take the sick and the weak from Prosperity to La Isla. Save them from a life of exploitation.",
  "267117": "I cannot watch my people struggling under the Pyrphorian yoke.",
  "267118": "We cannot rely on the old guard, they have given so much of their lives already.",
  "267119": "This shall be the moment our movement truly begins! New ideas, new energy!",
  "267120": "The young ones dream of something better. Better homes and a better life.",
  "267121": "Without somewhere to call home, it is over for them.",
  "267122": "These refugees, they have nowhere else to go.",
  "267123": "You have to learn to make what friends you can out here.",
  "267124": "I hate knowing the Empire or La Corona could just come here and crush us.",
  "267125": "I'm sure your Queen wants to go charging in like a bull in a china shop. But good people still live on Prosperity.",
  "267126": "I don't plan to leave anyone behind.",
  "267127": "Keep the people moving. Now is not the time to stop and think.",
  "267128": "All of us sticking together. That is the best chance we have of defending ourselves.",
  "267129": "Even a modest fleet would give us independence.",
  "267130": "It is not on land, but on water where we are vulnerable.",
  "267131": "Wow this ship is so beautiful!",
  "267132": "We shall name her after my brother, and pin a lock of his hair to the mast.",
  "267133": "Pyrphorian ships approach. I have never dealt with them face-to-face. What can they want?",
  "267134": "It is started—there's no going back. The Pyrphorians never give up.",
  "267135": "Everything we produce here, the Pyrphorians take.",
  "267136": "After the Pyrphorians come for the tithe, there is nothing left for us.",
  "267137": "The cat is out of the bag. Now they know you are involved.",
  "267138": "The Pyrphorian attack frightens them. Please, there must be room!",
  "267139": "My island too must be evacuated, it is no longer safe there.",
  "267140": "Many of my best were kidnapped. We have no hope of surviving without them.",
  "267141": "What if these people grow sick? They're going to need a hospital!",
  "267285": "My people's future is secure. They have you to thank for this.",
  "267353": "The contract… it is gone! The Pyrphorians must have stolen it during the attack. How did I fall for such a simple diversion!?",
  "267354": "You are going to have to inflitrate the Pyrphorians if you want to find that contract. I'm sorry.",
  "267355": "You beat the Pyrphorians at their own game!",
  "267356": "If you can convince the Queen to listen, we can explain to her.",
  "267357": "I would give you that stupid island, if only I had the contract to tear to pieces.",
  "267358": "We cannot thank you enough for preventing this war.",
  "267359": "With that contract, we are taking the Pyrphorians down from the inside.",
  "267360": "Prosperity is yours, take it! We have a new home now.",
  "267361": "Near Prosperity, the Pyrphorians would kill us on sight.",
  "267362": "At first I thought you were a spy of the Queen. Now I know your heart is in the right place.",
  "267363": "I can tell you where the contract is. After that it's down to you.",
  "267364": "Stay hidden, and you will succeed.",
  "267365": "The man I met was your Uncle? I thought he was a creep!",
  "267366": "I am sorry you had to go through all this just to have justice.",
  "267582": "Of course I will be a witness. After all you've done for us.",
  "267597": "With Prosperity off our hands, the Pyrphorians will leave us alone.",
  "267598": "Let me help you. I know I can make a difference.",
  "267599": "I will tell them everything I know.",
  "267600": "I don't need to take an oath to speak the truth.",
  "267601": "I hope as witness, I can prove the Pyrphorians were behind this deal, not us.",
  "267602": "I was certain it was your father that day, but now I know was wrong.",
  "267603": "Your majesty. Isabel Sarmento, at your service.",
  "267755": "We fight with you, no matter what.",
  "267763": "We can help you, just give us the sign.",
  "267764": "Exploit their supply lines! Small operations can have big rewards!",
  "267765": "Sabotage their supply lines! They rely on them as much as we do.",
  "267766": "There is no dent in their supply! We missed an opportunity!",
  "267767": "Ha, you did it! Without their precious fire they are nothing!",
  "267768": "You broke the chain! Now we are really somewhere.",
  "267769": "I never thought I would take the Empire's side!",
  "267770": "The Queen has promised to recognise our independence.",
  "267771": "I like Sir Archibald, he is a funny man.",
  "259831": "Of course we will take a stand beside you, if you are for freedom and justice!",
  "259832": "Now is the time for choosing sides. Just or unjust.",
  "259833": "We join on one condition, that like you we are free to write our own history.",
  "259834": "We can build on this.",
  "259835": "It is good news.",
  "259836": "Let's take nothing for granted.",
  "259837": "This is progress at least.",
  "259838": "We are all the stronger for this.",
  "259839": "A small win, but we'll take it.",
  "259840": "A flicker of hope.",
  "259841": "Champion of the underdog!",
  "259842": "I wanted to believe you'd come through.",
  "259843": "It takes courage to make a stand.",
  "259844": "I was right to trust you.",
  "259845": "Your heart is in the right place.",
  "259846": "You have achieved a lot.",
  "259847": "May there be more good news from you.",
  "259848": "It is only a setback.",
  "259849": "We will come back stronger.",
  "259850": "Nothing we aren't ready for.",
  "259851": "We can't give up.",
  "259852": "This cannot be allowed to harm our plans.",
  "259853": "We can find a way around this.",
  "259854": "We've seen worse.",
  "259855": "You should have more faith.",
  "259856": "Are you crazy?",
  "259857": "I thought we had trust.",
  "259858": "You will expose us.",
  "259859": "I don't want to cut ties with you.",
  "259860": "Ask youself, whose side are you on?",
  "259861": "Don't burn all your bridges.",
  "255402": "I am Isabel Sarmento and I will see my country freed. Are you with me or against me?",
  "255403": "I am Isabel Sarmento. Do not stand between me and my country's freedom!",
  "256854": "You are sure you weren't followed?",
  "256894": "Good to see a friendly face in these times.",
  "256895": "You are here to help?",
  "256896": "We're running low on everything, as usual.",
  "256897": "We search all our visitors - a necessary precaution.",
  "256898": "We would welcome more volunteers.",
  "256899": "Ready to evacuate at a moment's notice.",
  "260938": "This is where liberation starts.",
  "260939": "We make do with what we have.",
  "260940": "I hope they'll remember this as the birthplace of a revolution.",
  "260941": "This is our new home now, we should be happy for that.",
  "260942": "We've got to be agile, ready to move at the drop of a hat.",
  "260943": "We can load up in a day, and be gone in a night.",
  "260944": "It's hard to get ships. We are lucky to have friends to help us.",
  "260945": "We never sink a ship if we can take it.",
  "259862": "We won't forget this.",
  "259863": "I am so happy someone could help us.",
  "259864": "Words can't express how grateful we are.",
  "259865": "We could use a distraction.",
  "259866": "We can make it work.",
  "259867": "It is a risk worth taking.",
  "261059": "I'll join them again in the fields... my brothers and sisters, once we have set this land free.",
  "261061": "I was young when I joined the movement, I never imagined I would one day be giving the orders.",
  "261062": "This is not about revenge, but securing our people a future free of La Corona. We have to stick together.",
  "261063": "My brother fought back violently against La Corona. He was murdered. We have to try another way.",
  "261064": "If we strike against La Corona, we have to make it count!",
  "261060": "Jean is reckless like my brother was. I don't blame him. He is only trying to survive, to protect the ones he loves.",
  "261065": "Let Admiral Silva cling to his dying dream, we hear the little birds of freedom sing!",
  "261066": "La Corona may be our enemy, not the Queen, but to trust empire for us is impossible.",
  "261067": "If Anne Harlow could forget the past, we could build a better future together.",
  "261068": "Alonso is a powder keg. He threatens to destroy the delicate balance we've worked so hard for.",
  "261069": "Madame Kahina is the best. Quick, clean, and never draws attention. How does she do it?",
  "261070": "George dances well for an invalid, we all need to cut free sometimes.",
  "256689": "In future, keep your flagship intact, resources are scarce.",
  "259868": "There must be a better way.",
  "259869": "There is no time for this.",
  "259870": "This will not help our struggle.",
  "256970": "I've uncovered a meaty opportunity.",
  "256971": "You steam ahead, go on.",
  "256972": "Something fer you to fiddle with.",
  "256973": "Shine yer blow lamp on this would'yer?",
  "256974": "If you don't exploit this, some other bird will.",
  "256975": "Look at you go.",
  "256976": "Go then, I got stuff to do.",
  "256977": "That's it, gimme some peace.",
  "256978": "Fixed that up good, didn't yer.",
  "256979": "Nice juicy little oyster that is.",
  "256980": "Faster than the electric telegraph.",
  "256981": "Lickety-spit, you've come back quick.",
  "256982": "Corrr yeah, just how I likes it.",
  "256983": "Didn't take you for a Janus-face, fair play to yer.",
  "256984": "You've left the whole thing a ruddy jumble!",
  "256985": "Well that's the nail in the coffin.",
  "256986": "Luddite!",
  "256987": "Steaming pile full o' nothin'.",
  "256988": "Hurry or the flies'll start laying.",
  "256989": "What about my job?",
  "256990": "Sit on a firework would yer?",
  "256991": "Got another lamp needs lighting n'all.",
  "256992": "Sputter on little engine, I'll keep you greased.",
  "256993": "Wonderful, but I've got another turkey for you to pluck.",
  "256994": "Bit of a wrench, eh?",
  "256995": "Old Nate can make double-cross worth your while.",
  "256996": "Tied up the scrag ends?",
  "256997": "Cobbled somethin' together?",
  "256998": "Dug up more than bones?",
  "257235": "Want more? There is no more!",
  "257236": "Lean pickings at the moment.",
  "257237": "Not even a morsel for yer.",
  "259928": "Pumping pistons!",
  "259929": "No flies on me.",
  "259930": "I'm over the moon.",
  "259931": "I'm lighter than air.",
  "259932": "I'd be blown away, if not for me ropes…",
  "259933": "Whizbang!",
  "259934": "Soaring like a buzzard.",
  "259935": "You're flying!",
  "259936": "Self-propelled, I see.",
  "259937": "You make silk purses from sow's ears.",
  "259938": "Sift and you will find.",
  "259939": "You've got a spark.",
  "259940": "Something always drops from the pipe with you.",
  "259948": "You're dynamite!",
  "259941": "Rubbish!",
  "259942": "Fly-blown frass!",
  "259943": "It unhinges me!",
  "259944": "Soiled my day.",
  "259945": "Bahhh!",
  "259946": "Hollow piles o' dung.",
  "259947": "I haven't time for this!",
  "259949": "You're cranking my crank.",
  "259950": "Don't ratchet me temper!",
  "259951": "I'll 'ave yer bones!",
  "259952": "I've a bone to pick with you.",
  "259953": "Yer damp and dirty drape.",
  "259954": "Yer smudge-pot.",
  "259955": "Oily little toerag.",
  "255404": "Let me wipe me hand yer eminence. Turkey grease, see.",
  "255405": "You made a lucky find! I'm a go-to for scrags and cut-offs, knick-knacks and gravy.",
  "256855": "Is it rag or is it bone you're wantin'?",
  "256900": "Bear-skin, dog-skin, cat-skin.",
  "256901": "Eh? I'm trying to keep a low profile.",
  "256902": "I've a wealth o' parts, real odds and ends.",
  "256903": "You've got me by the Diri-giblets, whaddya want?",
  "256904": "You wouldn't be after a mountain of lint would ya?",
  "256905": "What's that I can smell on you, pickled eggs?",
  "260950": "Should hold together for a time.",
  "260951": "Soldiers had no use for the iron, all frozen such as they were.",
  "260952": "I scratched and scraped for this.",
  "260953": "I always dreamed of a little shack to call my own.",
  "260954": "She used to be a wreck, but you'd never guess.",
  "260955": "I put a lot o' graft into fixing her up.",
  "260956": "The bow's made o' hodgepodge.",
  "260957": "Made of sterner stuff— like boiled hooves.",
  "259956": "How touching.",
  "259957": "I'm a grateful sackful.",
  "259958": "Tinker very much.",
  "259959": "I'm in.",
  "259960": "Could be worse I s'pose.",
  "259961": "Then what we waitin' for, let's get stuck in.",
  "261089": "Semaphore stations'll soon be disused - there's a tip for old iron.",
  "261091": "Found an egg with a palace in it. Fixed the hinge and stuck it on the bow of my lady blimp.",
  "261092": "Zeppelins'll take off, you'll see. Soon they'll all want a piece of my lady blimp.",
  "261093": "Turn a greasy hat inside out, and it looks to 'ave been oiled purposely!",
  "261094": "Coffins make nice boats. But make sure the lid doesn't shut on you.",
  "261090": "Isabel's people are resistors, fighting for their Ohms.",
  "261095": "I could use George Smith's bath chair, once he's gone. Can't be long now can it?",
  "261096": "Archibald Blake commissioned the Queen a balloon, then he realised it was all a lot of hot air.",
  "261097": "The Queen may have snatched every last bit of land and sea, but I have the skies to meself.",
  "261098": "Alonso's good to follow at a distance; for all the leftovers.",
  "261099": "That windsock Willie still complaining? The lad doesn't know his luck.",
  "261100": "Don't dabble with Kahina, she's a lethal businesswoman.",
  "261101": "I offered Bente a place on my balloon, but she guffawed and called it cheating!",
  "255597": "That fell into place.",
  "255598": "Bit fer you, chunk for me.",
  "255599": "A few sundries.",
  "255600": "Some nice little slivers in there.",
  "255601": "Something for nothing!",
  "255602": "We hammered something out.",
  "255603": "I'm an impulsive shopper myself.",
  "259962": "I won't be manipulated.",
  "259963": "What's in it for me?",
  "259964": "Gorr, take me for an idiot?",
  "268053": "Well, it's time for me to move on. Until we meet again!",
  "264848": "You're going to need your best ship and crew, only for it to sink to the icy bottom! Hehehe.",
  "264849": "Terrible waste of human life of course, but don't let that stop you.",
  "264850": "And be sure to prepare for the final curtain while you're at it.",
  "264851": "You really do have quite the desire to depart don't ya? Well it's your funeral.",
  "264852": "Never mind, eh! At least you won't die a block of ice.",
  "264853": "Seems a long way to go to die, but you look ready for it.",
  "264854": "Take your time, won't make a difference to Sir John.",
  "264855": "Congratulations! You crossed seven seas for a wasteland!",
  "264856": "Couldn't even shoot yerself in the foot? Well I feel sorry for ya.",
  "264857": "The whole expedition's a failure. But we all know that teamwork drivel's a myth.",
  "264858": "See— never worth getting mixed up in other people's business.",
  "264859": "What a waste of time! Just goes to show, you can't rely on others.",
  "264860": "There's nothing up there but the ruddy cold.",
  "264861": "Hoping this will keep your head above water? Not Arctic water it won't.",
  "264862": "Dunno why you're so desperate for your eyeballs to freeze.",
  "264863": "At best we'll be pulling stiffs out the ice like teeth.",
  "264864": "Like frostbite do ya? Botulism? Scurvy? Got that all to look forward to.",
  "264865": "The Arctic's no more than a mariner's graveyard. Ooh, hang fire...",
  "264866": "As we're here, we might ask the Inuits if they chanced upon any lost property...",
  "264867": "The equipment won't have decomposed like the cadavers.",
  "264868": "We've a responsibility to Sir John to gather up his valuables.",
  "264869": "Hard to feel the cold when you see a glint, ain't it? Hehe.",
  "264870": "Found nothing but emptiness, why isn't I surprised?",
  "264871": "The deeper we go, the more likely we find something really juicy.",
  "264872": "You want an Icebreaker, so we can get to the fancy stuff.",
  "264873": "Never know what you'll find inside, if you don't crack things open.",
  "264874": "Now we can finally see if Sir John bequeaths us summat shiny.",
  "264875": "You need to grow yourself some tusks, my walrus-friend, or we'll never snag the goodies.",
  "264876": "What d'you wanna help those old duffers for? Unless...you've sniffed summat out?",
  "264877": "I've heard the Arctic Council ships are plushly furnished.",
  "264878": "Shame they had to still be alive and we couldn't just help ourselves.",
  "264879": "As long as their pocket watches still tick we should try afresh.",
  "264880": "Never should o' come here, why do you think they call it a wasteland?",
  "264881": "Looks like we'll have to dig up Sir John Faithful's army o' the dead another day.",
  "264882": "Shame we couldn't find 'em, I was looking forward to expanding my collection of brass buttons.",
  "264883": "Lady Faithful hopes to resurrect her marriage, but Sir John's got cold feet, hehehe.",
  "264884": "Ice might even have helped preserve the merchandise.",
  "264885": "I think we all know where Sir John Faithful is now, don't we? He's dead.",
  "264886": "I know her old man’s long dead, but his lavish instruments won’t be, eh?",
  "264887": "Don't be afraid to see the frozen look as you frisk their corpses, you’ll get used to it.",
  "264888": "You can see a body a mile off out here, nice and exposed.",
  "264889": "Knowing those old toffs, they'd probably skin each other before they'd skin a seal.",
  "264890": "I 'spect there's a few nice bits and bobs suspended about the place.",
  "264891": "Can't always wait til things are dead y'know...",
  "264892": "No-one'll notice the odd body. If they're well-preserved, we could sell 'em for dissection.",
  "264893": "Can't believe how much an Inuit'll give ya for a tarnished spoon, hehe.",
  "264894": "I'd have come before, if I'd known how easy it is to fleece the locals.",
  "264895": "If you're looking for the Hades and Styx, you're going in the right direction, hehe.",
  "264896": "We can really milk this predicament for all it's got, as long as we're quiet.",
  "264897": "Two years in a blizzard probably doesn't do your skin much good, does it?",
  "264898": "Now, we don't want to look like we're only in it for the proceeds.",
  "264899": "Now we're onto something. Let's hope for a shipwreck!",
  "264900": "I hope those ships are stuck fast in the ice, free for the taking!",
  "264901": "Ain't you wondering what's left of them ships?",
  "264905": "Blimey, by foot!? This all looks very grim all of a sudden, doesn't it?!",
  "264906": "Afraid? Never seen a real corpse?",
  "264908": "If Lady Faithful thinks they're still alive let's humour the poor woman's delusion shall we?",
  "264909": "Let's get to the bottom of this mystery, and what's become of 'em.",
  "264910": "You'd think you'd seen a ghost, what's frozen yer?",
  "264911": "Some of them live?! Brings a tear to an old man's eye.",
  "264912": "Why d'you have to fade away before the final payoff!",
  "264913": "Heavens what a name, no wonder their luck, eh?",
  "264914": "You seem drawn to death, that's why I stick to you like fishglue.",
  "264915": "This place is more indifferent to humankind than I am.",
  "264916": "Cast your eyes about for any tidbits in the snow.",
  "264917": "Lady Faithful's bewitched, she won't notice if we shuffle off for a bit.",
  "264918": "A place so curious must have its curiosities…",
  "264919": "What's all this endeavour of yours for?",
  "264920": "A lot of furry animals out here.",
  "264921": "These Inuit geezers are a help though, ain't they?",
  "264922": "There are times even I give the dead their due.",
  "264923": "Nothing but bone.",
  "264924": "A sight to chill even someone as soulless as myself.",
  "264925": "I think we could all use a tot of hot brandy.",
  "264926": "Even I'd start to miss the sight of other beings out here.",
  "264927": "We've come to a place of solitude.",
  "264928": "I can't bear to watch you do this to yourself.",
  "264929": "I thought you would end icebound too, but for your icebreaker.",
  "267204": "You can count on that, heheh! The noble old dame belongs to one of the most prosperous families there is.",
  "267205": "Most likely all those poor mugs indulging her husband are drowned or chewing on their own bones, but like I said, where that much lucre's rolling in, I'll never be far behind! How's about you?",
  "267226": "Yeah, go on and help the old dame send even more ships to be lost in the nothingness. Looks like you finally found your captain Ahab.",
  "267227": "Meanwhile, I will set up me own little camp nearby. Just in case you need anything, Ishmael!",
  "267241": "So you're off to the icy marrow with the old dame, brrr. Don't get lost will yer, guv? You're me best customer!",
  "267263": "All those ships transmuting into ghosts. And then... silence.",
  "266476": "There you are. I thought you may have begun without me.",
  "266477": "But… I’m Old Nate! don’t you recognise me?",
  "266478": "Don’t do this to me! You know how I love musicals.",
  "266479": "I know, / a lowly intern painted me / And he was badly paid / I know / I have no proper face / And now I look like a disgrace / I know / A lowly intern cobbled me / The team just stood and laughed. / I know / for colour there’s no money in the purse / And the midday sun / ensures I look ten times worse",
  "266480": "Please say, that i am “in”. / My heart it breaks in twain. / And If, I cannot sing, woe! / What will I do then, oh? / Come now, shake my hand!",
  "266481": "Yeah / I saw the whole thing coming / Now it’s time for me to go. / Dear mother she was a sketching book / And even she loathes how I look",
  "255518": "Why not share some of my daily hell with you...",
  "255519": "What I wouldn't give to get out of my shuttered bureau.",
  "255520": "Guilty until you prove yourself innocent.",
  "255522": "Think of it as 'hard evidence' of your character.",
  "255521": "I hereby sentence you to not-very-hard labour.",
  "255523": "See you on the other side.",
  "255524": "A tiny crack of light.",
  "255525": "You're getting off lightly.",
  "255526": "It all looks in order.",
  "255527": "Case closed.",
  "255528": "Justice served.",
  "255529": "Back on the straight and narrow.",
  "255530": "So, a law-abider!",
  "255531": "How do you manage to wriggle out of it?",
  "255532": "You broke the key off in the lock!",
  "255533": "The scales of justice don't balance themselves!",
  "255534": "The jury are very much out on you!",
  "255535": "You will be held accountable!",
  "255536": "If I must be a good citizen, so must you.",
  "255537": "You can't escape duty, believe me we've all tried.",
  "255538": "I know where you live.",
  "255539": "You're a link in a clanking chain of events...",
  "255540": "Oh there's no end of work at Her Majesty's pleasure...",
  "255541": "Are you a glutton for punishment?",
  "255542": "Don't let them corrupt you too.",
  "255543": "This is a matter of sovereign law!",
  "255544": "Have your investigations been fruitful?",
  "255545": "Ready to bail me out?",
  "255546": "Coming clean?",
  "257238": "As quiet now as it'll ever be.",
  "257239": "No shortage of crims, just a shortage of leads.",
  "257240": "I don't have anything straightforward.",
  "255937": "Keep an eye to the horizon for miscreants.",
  "255938": "It's as bad out there as it is inside.",
  "255939": "Needless to say an escort must be watchful.",
  "259748": "To work with the lowest, yet answer only to God and the Queen. How many can say that?",
  "259749": "Surely the choice is black and white, what with my clean record executing justice.",
  "259750": "It's not my job to know their crimes, only to find a fitting punishment.",
  "259751": "Everything seems in order.",
  "259752": "I see no crime in this.",
  "259753": "All running like clockwork.",
  "259754": "Duty has its rewards.",
  "259755": "A break from hard labour.",
  "259756": "A light through the bars!",
  "259757": "No less than is deserved.",
  "259758": "Excellent.",
  "259759": "Whatever your methods, you hide them well.",
  "259760": "You run a tight ship.",
  "259761": "I attest to your probity.",
  "259762": "You execute well.",
  "259763": "Your techniques are efficient.",
  "259764": "Exemplary conduct.",
  "259765": "This warrants an inquiry!",
  "259766": "Someone will hang for this.",
  "259767": "Criminal.",
  "259768": "Never would have passed on my watch.",
  "259769": "Everything, everyone, is suspect.",
  "259770": "I will raise an injunction!",
  "259771": "It's misery by proxy.",
  "259772": "Your negligence is criminal.",
  "259773": "Careful you don't end up on my island.",
  "259774": "So you were the perpetrator!",
  "259775": "If you aren't with me, villain…",
  "259776": "You tread a very thin line.",
  "259777": "Fall foul of me, and fall foul of sovereign law.",
  "259778": "Don't expect to get off scot-free.",
  "255398": "Tell me you are moral, and not yet another crook-fingered wretch.",
  "255399": "Her majesty leans on me to detain any who defile her sovereign laws. Including you.",
  "256856": "What makes you think I trust you?",
  "256882": "Not everything of yours is out in the open.",
  "256883": "I'm watching your every move.",
  "256884": "God scourges those with something to hide.",
  "256885": "I am the instrument to bear out his judgment.",
  "256886": "Just how is your conscience?",
  "256887": "My life is my prison.",
  "260922": "All the punishments you see are more than justified!",
  "260923": "Too late to recover these sinners from Satan.",
  "260924": "No way out, and no way in. Well, except through the door.",
  "260925": "Look at them. Sickening specimens.",
  "260926": "Don't try and rock the boat.",
  "260927": "Meticulously drilled, and loyal to the crown.",
  "260928": "Transportation worse than prison? Don't be so sure!",
  "260929": "The antithesis of Noah's Ark.",
  "259779": "Justice served.",
  "259780": "Community service is it?",
  "259781": "That's the least I'm due for my suffering.",
  "259782": "If we must.",
  "259783": "I permit it.",
  "259784": "Seems legitimate.",
  "261031": "This rock's for the worst of the worst, you'll not find a goodly soul upon it!",
  "261033": "I've got better things to do than bleat with you over H.M.'s rotten biscuits and insipid tea.",
  "261034": "The chimpanzees can swing about as much as they like inside— good practice for the gallows.",
  "261035": "Give 'em an inch, they take a mile. They even have their own cells now!",
  "261036": "Do I condemn you now, or merely give you a length of rope with which to strangle yourself?",
  "261032": "All Her Majesty asks of me, is that I keep the peace.",
  "261037": "Malching must know that crime never pays.",
  "261038": "If I could break one of Beryl's urchins, we'd have her head in the gibbet.",
  "261039": "I don't think Sir Archibald has the stomach for my work.",
  "261041": "Anne Harlow proves even the nobility can be corrupted by the Devil.",
  "261040": "I saw Benjamin Harlow drop, and will see his pirate niece Anne hang just the same!",
  "261042": "Jean LaFortune should stop gambling on his life, and hand himself in.",
  "261043": "Is it only Madame Kahina's prices that are criminal, or is there some truth to these rumours about her past?",
  "261044": "Sarmento is a myth, or we'd have had her in for interrogation long ago.",
  "261045": "Admiral Silva serves a different Empire, and is therefore not in my jurisdiction.",
  "261046": "Graves will be caught, and when he is he will pay the maximum possible penalty.",
  "255604": "All perfectly legal.",
  "255605": "I shall keep the receipt.",
  "255606": "If I find there is anything wrong…",
  "255607": "Hm. Very Well.",
  "255608": "This better not be a con!",
  "255609": "I still don't trust you.",
  "255610": "Not enough to call it extortion.",
  "259787": "Not interested.",
  "259788": "Nix to it!",
  "259789": "I'm going to have to shut it off.",
  "261192": "I've no doubt corruption runs in the family, and I'll be watching you closely.",
  "261193": "Don't drag me into your conspiracy theories. Everybody knows your father was a crook.",
  "267901": "You don't know what it's like, trying to keep a lid on this jar of rats.",
  "267902": "Samuel's suicide was his confession. Why are you trying to complicate things?",
  "261194": "If you weed out a single Pyrphorian you are to bring them to me first for questioning! Is that understood?",
  "266603": "A shame Edvard never had a taste of real justice.",
  "266604": "I had been looking forward to putting Edvard's head through the noose. Never mind.",
  "266605": "Surely there is someone to punish for all of this!?",
  "265035": "Think turning in sinners maketh you an angel? I know all about your family.",
  "265062": "Hmm, a delivery? Dead or alive?",
  "266227": "He is ready for transportation.",
  "266229": "I can't think why he'd be worth anything. Everyone here is beyond redemption…",
  "266844": "I don't do favours for the children of traitors. Or does that look tell me you're willing to pay…?",
  "266845": "I'm sure it won't be too long before Edvard contrives to have him back in prison.",
  "266846": "I don't care why Edvard sent them here. That's his business.",
  "266847": "Your father's death was a routine suicide. We get them all the time.",
  "266848": "Nothing in this prison escapes my notice, if there was any funny business with your father's death I'd have known about it!",
  "267661": "I lick my lips at the prospect of another Goode family tribunal.",
  "267666": "People who disappoint the monarch often end up with me.",
  "267667": "And the Queen is going to be there. What a treat.",
  "267668": "Don't think you will get all the plaudits. Crime is my bag.",
  "267669": "Your sister is very keen to see justice done. I will use all the tools at my disposal to ensure that is the case.",
  "267670": "The problem with public inquiries is everything's out in the open.",
  "267671": "Imagine serving twenty years in the system, and never getting a sniff of a trial like this.",
  "267672": "Obviously you'll need my official authorisation of transfer if you want your prisoner brought to the dock!",
  "267673": "Everything relating to the prison and its prisoners has to go through me!",
  "267152": "So there you are, the traitor's children!",
  "267153": "Oh, spare me the nauseating drivel! Flogging Queenie's peachy island in the New World to some rebel upstarts?! Ha! Traitor is too generous a word!",
  "267154": "He hung himself in one of my cells. I'd call that a rather conclusive admission of guilt.",
  "267155": "Oh I vaguely remember him. Stubborn, with a loose mouth, just as innocent as all the others.",
  "267156": "He is small fry, a bail has been set.",
  "267157": "Pay every penny of his money and I will place him immediately at your disposal.",
  "255547": "How about a contract for the Emporium Exotique?",
  "255548": "An especially exclusive assignment.",
  "255549": "Not so long ago I'd have dealt with this myself...",
  "255550": "I can't promise it won't be dangerous.",
  "255551": "I have need of a fellow professional...",
  "255552": "Glad you find it exciting.",
  "255553": "Let me know when you've done the deed.",
  "255554": "You're keen.",
  "255555": "The consummate professional.",
  "255556": "I had a feeling you'd do well.",
  "255557": "I forget what it's like to have it on my hands.",
  "255558": "I'd be curious to know your methods.",
  "255559": "Quick and clean, I'm impressed.",
  "255560": "The reality of it hit you?",
  "255561": "You lack the guts to carry it through.",
  "255562": "Honour is priceless.",
  "255563": "Consider our connection severed.",
  "255564": "You have to learn to be ruthless.",
  "255565": "Take your time.",
  "255566": "You should put your clients first.",
  "255567": "I won't teach you to suck eggs.",
  "255568": "Take a long, deep, breath, and on to the next one.",
  "255569": "I hope it's not all too rich for you.",
  "255570": "Once you get drawn in, it's hard to get out.",
  "255571": "Later you'll wish you'd done it all differently.",
  "255572": "I have contacts, remember?",
  "255573": "Is it done?",
  "255574": "You have something for me, don't you?",
  "255575": "You can't keep it a secret from me.",
  "257241": "All is tranquil, thank you.",
  "257242": "As quiet as the afternoon.",
  "257243": "Nothing going on.",
  "257244": "Expensive, don't let it go astray.",
  "257245": "I'd rather not lose that ship.",
  "257246": "They may strike when we least expect.",
  "261196": "I may have known your father as a good man, but I don't know you at all.",
  "261198": "Be careful out there. The rainforest is full of surprises.",
  "261199": "Justice, revenge—the truth is never black and white.",
  "266598": "Blow away the shadows, for all our sakes.",
  "266599": "Ruthless when you had to be, I like that. The world is rid of a great evil.",
  "266835": "There was a time when I took any opportunity that came my way, just like you.",
  "266836": "Through all the smoke, I see a glimmer in you.",
  "266837": "Choose your customers, don't let them choose you.",
  "266253": "The mark of the Pyrphorians. This sign of fire is reserved for those they wish death upon.",
  "266254": "I never knew your father was mixed up with the Pyrphorians—a grave malevolence.",
  "266255": "You may be wild, child, but don’t go to the new world, don’t rouse the dragon from its slumber.",
  "266954": "No surprise to hear criminals are drawn here, they go where the money goes.",
  "266957": "A lot of strange people like to meet in my harbour. That's the nature of the business.",
  "266958": "Too many shadows to know where one starts and another begins.",
  "266959": "Don't be stubborn like your father. Stay away from the new world, Prosperity—it is the source of all your troubles.",
  "266960": "Your father was one of the few honest traders.",
  "266961": "Your father was a dear friend to me. To think the killer hid himself in my harbour…",
  "266962": "Smoke rises on the horizon. A threat emerges.",
  "266963": "Your father was singled out. The Queen's most trusted. I know how these schemes work.",
  "266964": "The Pyrphorians keep themselves very secret. They may be watching your every step!",
  "266965": "The Pyrphorians are an arcane sect. Invisible, yet everywhere.",
  "259791": "If you're after something unique, you can expect to pay for it.",
  "259792": "The Emporium Exotique doesn't open its doors to just anyone you know.",
  "259793": "You're looking for something, and I can help you find it.",
  "259794": "Isn't that a curiosity.",
  "259795": "Intriguing.",
  "259796": "What an exciting turn.",
  "259797": "This is turning into quite a story.",
  "259798": "Exhilarating.",
  "259799": "So, the secret's out.",
  "259800": "A good outcome.",
  "259801": "Maybe I was wrong about you.",
  "259802": "You've got my attention.",
  "259803": "What a killer instinct.",
  "259804": "There's merchant in you.",
  "259805": "You can be quite cutthroat.",
  "259806": "You've rocked the apple cart.",
  "259807": "I like the way you set out your stall.",
  "259808": "What a surprise.",
  "259809": "Just as expected.",
  "259810": "And life once seemed so thrilling.",
  "259811": "Typical.",
  "259812": "What a tangle.",
  "259813": "I anticipated that.",
  "259814": "Disappointing.",
  "259815": "You'll have to do better than that.",
  "259816": "That's your best offer?",
  "259817": "Are you wasting my time?",
  "259818": "You need to be more ruthless.",
  "259819": "Not much in the way of business sense.",
  "259820": "I've seen some stupid things…",
  "259821": "Oh you're not another one of those…",
  "255400": "The Emporium Exotique looks forward to your patronage - if you can afford it.",
  "255401": "My curiosities come from far and wide - for the more discerning customer.",
  "256857": "Welcome to the Emporium Exotique.",
  "256888": "Don't touch.",
  "256889": "I can tell you're searching for something.",
  "256890": "Just browsing?",
  "256891": "I'm here if you need me.",
  "256892": "Can I help you?",
  "256893": "Go on then, let's hear your daring tales.",
  "260930": "I hope you aren't looking for life here.",
  "260931": "I used to dangle from the eaves of buildings like these.",
  "260932": "My customers appreciate the tranquillity.",
  "260933": "After everything, I can forgive some peace and quiet.",
  "260934": "It's wise to be ready to move on, to take change in your stride.",
  "260935": "My routes crisscross the globe, to ensure I have the best to offer.",
  "260936": "You don't always need to run a tight ship.",

  "255614": "An exclusive deal.",
  "255615": "Not the biggest contract I've executed.",

  "251125": "The Jorgensen Trust only doubt my ability, because they've not see the proposal in full! Profit is no longer the mission, only joy!",
  "251126": "The Jorgensen dynasty dates back at least as far as the early 15th century. Evidence suggests we are a warm-hearted clan!",
  "251127": "Read boustrophedon in the dark on a stormy sea, and then tell me anything isn't possible!",
  "251128": "Oh? I've never seen George grumpy, he's such a caring man with so many remarkable stories!",

  "260844": "Admiral Vicente does have a very cold sort of laugh.",
  "260845": "It is emboldening to be among Jean La Fortune's young and aspiring people!",
  "260846": "I still believe the Jorgensen Trust would be of interest to Her Majesty the Queen.",
  "260847": "If ever you lack inspiration, seek Sir Archie, he is ever so happy to help!",
  "260848": "Poor Anne Harlow. It does distress me to see how her star has fallen.",
  "260849": "Old Nate has a lovely time up in that balloon. Perhaps he could make one for me!",
  "260850": "I wish I were Isabel. Clever and cunning, and fighting for freedom!",
  "260851": "I simply love Madame Kahina's shop, I hope it doesn't bother her I never buy anything.",
  "260852": "I'm sure like so many others, Edvard could have been a good person.",
  "260853": "Mr. Bleakworth does isolate himself, he should really try and take some fresh air.",

  "251135": "I'm so glad you never cheat me.",
  "251136": "Wonderful how trade brings people together!",
  "251815": "You're an erstwhile supporter of the Jorgensen Trust!",
  "251816": "So many expeditions funded by your trade!",
  "251817": "Our special trading relationship has saved lives!",
  "251294": "I hope this agreement agreeable!",
  "251295": "Ought really to have asked my advisors first!",
  "251296": "I'm bursting with ideas!",
  "251297": "This has to be the start of something special!",
  "251298": "Isn't negotiation thrilling!",
  "251299": "A wonderful opportunity for change!",
  "251300": "A proposal!",
  "251328": "I'm actually quite cross.",
  "251329": "My advisors don't appear to like you.",
  "251330": "I learned intimidation from camels.",
  "251331": "Are you ready for my haka dance?!",
  "251338": "Oh how fabulous!",
  "251342": "Extremely generous terms.",
  "251343": "I mean, if you're absolutely sure…!",
  "251344": "You've even convinced the board!",
  "251345": "Ideal for the Jorgensen Trust!",
  "251356": "No need to sell yourself short!",
  "251357": "Too generous for me to possibly accept!",
  "251358": "I think that's too good to be true...",
  "251359": "For some reason my advisors won't allow it!",
  "251360": "Oh! The board have put in a veto.",
  "256135": "Expedition about to leave, must dash.",
  "256167": "Let's try again when we're fresh!",
  "256168": "I think we both could use a rest.",
  "256169": "Enough fun for one day!",
  "256170": "The trust summons me away, sorry!",
  "251378": "My clever advisors have adjustments!",
  "251379": "Good start! My turn!",
  "251380": "Very little to amend here!",
  "251395": "I need a little sit down.",
  "251396": "Yes, of course.",
  "251397": "But—I'm so nice??",
  "251404": "Almost fell for that one!",
  "251405": "Ooh! I'll be just as daring and refuse!",
  "251406": "Don't be silly! You're not the sort to be malicious!",
  "251524": "Charity makes me feel all warm inside.",
  "251526": "Don't mention it!",
  "251527": "I'm making myself useful!",
  "251528": "I convinced the board!",
  "251529": "You are a worthy cause!",
  "251535": "The board insist!",
  "251536": "It'll be good in the long run!",
  "251537": "We should focus on the positives!",
  "251538": "This is so unlike me.",
  "251539": "I was outvoted!",
  "251540": "Lion cubs often have little playfights!",
  "251541": "I can't believe I'm doing this!",
  "251542": "I have trust in the board's decision to go to war.",
  "251543": "Peace begins with a smile.",
  "251544": "We never really wanted to hurt one another.",
  "251546": "A break from killing can be nice sometimes.",
  "251547": "No need to hurt people all of the time!",
  "251557": "We don't even have to trade, it's just in case...",
  "251559": "Any opportunity to work together!",
  "251560": "I just know you'll make a special partner!",
  "251575": "The Jorgensen trustees annul our trade!",
  "251576": "We'll trade again soon!",
  "251577": "I want to do my own thing for a while.",
  "251639": "We will be so much stronger together!",
  "251640": "The cherry atop our beautiful friendship-cake!",
  "251641": "I had no say in this sad sad farewell!",
  "251650": "The Jorgensen Trust ended our alliance!",
  "251678": "I want to look after everyone.",
  "251679": "A thank you for all you've done!",
  "251680": "A tiny something to keep you going!",
  "251753": "A lovely surprise!",
  "251754": "You're ever so dependable!",
  "251755": "A joy to behold!",
  "251756": "The Trust will be so pleased!",
  "251757": "You're too kind.",
  "251758": "Why so mean?",
  "251759": "How unexpected.",
  "251760": "Gasp.",
  "251761": "Crikey!",
  "251762": "You mustn't!",
  "251763": "War? Wham, just like that!",
  "251764": "War? But...I feel suddenly horribly dizzy!",
  "251765": "You really weren't joking, when you said war...",
  "251766": "A little ray of sunshine!",
  "251767": "Wonderful! I live for peace!",
  "251768": "I'm glad you spared a thought for our poor soldier-y people!",
  "251769": "With this, we are one step closer to peace!",
  "251770": "Trade is vital to opening cultural dialogues.",
  "251771": "A major partner like you will delight the board.",
  "251772": "Now we both benefit from each others' charity!",
  "251773": "I didn't think it would end so soon!",
  "251774": "Oh, well a change is as good as a rest!",
  "251775": "That's not what I'd bargained on!",
  "251780": "You mean we weren't allies already?!",
  "251781": "No need to be so formal, of course I accept!",
  "251782": "I think we all like to be on our own sometimes.",
  "251783": "I shall treasure the time we had as friends.",
  "251790": "What a selfless act of charity!",
  "251791": "All proceeds go directly to the Trust!",
  "251796": "Oh! Don't think I've ever come across one of those...",
  "251797": "I always dreamed of becoming young and naïve!",
  "251798": "You are one of the funniest people I know.",
  "251799": "Hats are terribly fun to make fun of!",
  "251800": "I should be delighted to change the subject!",
  "251801": "Oh, how extraordinarily specific!",
  "251802": "Gallantry can be embarrassing...",
  "251803": "I like to fill awkward silences by talking.",
  "251804": "That's very clear advice.",
  "251805": "My advisors say that too.",
  "251806": "I won't be looking that up in the dictionary.",
  "251807": "You're right, butter does melt in my mouth!",
  "251808": "Oh yes, I am a bit of a gigglemug.",
  "251809": "So sweet of you to say! Even if others are twice as generous!",
  "251810": "You're right it was a challenging waterfall! I should probably allow myself a pat on the back.",
  "251811": "Well I do make a point of learning about other cultures - other human beings!",
  "254781": "Didn't think I'd forgotten you did you!",
  "254796": "We can be the most fabulous friends!",
  "254797": "I'm still so excited for us!",
  "254798": "Still so many adventures out there for us.",
  "254799": "I try to like people a little more every day.",
  "254800": "It gladdens me to be reminded of your positivity!",
  "254801": "I'm a happy person, you're a happy person!",
  "254802": "There's a charitable heart in there, I'm sure of it!",
  "254782": "Hurts terribly when friendships fade.",
  "254803": "I feel awful about us losing touch!",
  "254804": "I'd hoped to be on best terms with everyone.",
  "254805": "There is a noble heart in you somewhere.",
  "254806": "I'll always think the best of you, really I will.",
  "254807": "I've been so busy with the Trust and so forth!",
  "254808": "I for one won't stop believing in our being friends.",
  "254809": "So sad when good friends drift apart.",
  "265514": "Seems like you two are getting along!",
  "265515": "Isn't it nice when people are pleasant to one another?",
  "265517": "And they say I can be pleasant with anyone…",
  "265518": "There's good in everyone, but here I must look hard to see it…",
  "265520": "Why can't we all just be friends?",
  "265521": "It would be wrong not to stand by my companion in this.",
  "265523": "You can't please everyone. Believe me, I've tried.",
  "265524": "Sometimes it's hard not to let one's feeling show....",
  "265516": "It makes me sad to know my friends are being deceived.",
  "265519": "You're not trying to trick people, are you?",
  "265522": "I don't normally like dishonesty...",
  "265525": "As long as there's nothing criminal involved.",
  "256659": "Oh yes, forget about silly old us!",
  "256660": "Your people seem so sophisticated!",
  "256661": "We're happy to be left behind!",
  "256664": "Yes, don't trail behind me out of politeness!",
  "256665": "Your people have great potential!",
  "256666": "You'll be advancing again in no time!",
  "256669": "Now you've got more islands than me!",
  "256670": "I suppose expansion is always good.",
  "256671": "Amazing you know what to do with them all.",
  "257037": "I see you're exploring yet more islands!",
  "257038": "As long as you preserve what's already there!",
  "256672": "You'll be spreading out again in no time, I'm sure!",
  "256673": "See, a whole world waits for us to explore!",
  "256674": "That's it old bean, spread out!",
  "257039": "I've probably settled too many islands!",
  "257040": "If I can expand, you most certainly can!",
  "251836": "I just want to show how much I believe in you!",
  "251837": "The Jorgensen Trust only invests in worthy causes!",
  "251838": "Co-operation is the key to success!",
  "251839": "It's really up to the Trustees as to whether the island will be taken over...",
  "251840": "The Trustees say whatever we do will be in your interest!",
  "251842": "Thank you for the vote of confidence.",
  "251843": "Must be you want to finance the museum.",
  "251844": "Doing your bit for charity, are you?",
  "251845": "I'm sure you'd do a much better job with the place than I…",
  "251846": "The Jorgensen Trustees are uneasy about the future of the island.",
  "251847": "So good of you to save a secret garden just for me!",
  "251848": "Such impressive foliage! And I have you to thank.",
  "251851": "Every penny from auction goes to the Jorgensen Trust!",
  "251852": "Please, do something wonderful with it!",
  "251855": "My old island seems so desolate now.",
  "251856": "All the work of the Jorgensen Trust has been undone.",
  "251857": "All my efforts on that island have gone to waste.",
  "251858": "You can take all the credit for any finds I make here.",
  "251859": "Startling brush-footed butterflies! Please allow me the chance to study them?",
  "251860": "This would be an excellent spot for a base camp?",
  "251915": "I wish we wouldn't fight.",
  "251916": "I've turned into a monster!",
  "251917": "This is awful.",
  "251918": "I hope you're happy.",
  "251919": "I'm going mad!",
  "251965": "You must have no joy in your life.",
  "251966": "Did you fire by mistake?",
  "251967": "What of charity?",
  "251968": "I'm an easy target, after all!",
  "251969": "I suppose I am one of the weakest.",
  "251980": "This never needed to happen!",
  "251981": "Did I really do that?!",
  "251982": "Totally out of character, I assure you!",
  "251983": "That was paid for from a children's fund.",
  "251984": "Those poor sailors!",
  "251985": "You must feel terrible.",
  "251986": "This isn't who I am.",
  "251987": "Please, don't blame me.",
  "251989": "To destroy is so much easier than to create!",
  "251990": "Was it so ugly that it had to come down?",
  "251994": "A part of me I never wanted to explore.",
  "251995": "These feelings terrify me.",
  "252089": "I don't think this will be the end of your tyranny.",
  "252090": "Perhaps you'll be depriving children of their warm blankets next?",
  "251997": "It's simply unbearable to have to do away with someone who should have been a friend!",
  "252044": "You merciless, tyrannical, thuggish, brute. Why am I so nice, when I should have been selfish, and cut off your head?",
  "252045": "You could have talked things through…",
  "252046": "Do you have no regard for life?",
  "252047": "Still a tragedy, though we never saw eye-to-eye.",
  "252048": "I still wouldn't wish that on anyone.",
  "252049": "You want to protect what is dear to you.",
  "252050": "Most species have some form of defence.",
  "252051": "Back against the wall, I might do the same.",
  "252052": "It is instinct to want to shield our families.",
  "252075": "I'm sure you have reasons.",
  "252076": "The advisory board is impressed by your might.",

  "256194": "Why couldn't you just let me extort you!",
  "250382": "I'll be the one who does the exploiting!",
  "250383": "The fat needs trimming.",
  "250384": "As I want it, or not at all…",

  "250390": "What will you do? Pepper me with haberdasher's buttons?",
  "250391": "You'll appreciate this.",
  "250392": "Let me help you.",
  "250393": "Here's charity.",
  "250394": "No need to thank me.",
  "250395": "And they say I'm unkind...",
  "250396": "Well, what did you expect?!",
  "250397": "Eat humble pie.",
  "250398": "You pushed me to this.",
  "250399": "You deserve even worse.",
  "250400": "Let me put you in your place.",
  "250401": "I wage war against you and your pigeon-liver plebs.",
  "250402": "A war with you is a surefire investment.",
  "250403": "House von Malching goes to war!",
  "250404": "This war is a waste of time for both of us.",
  "250405": "What if I were to let you off the hook?",
  "250406": "Better let you catch your breath.",
  "250407": "Towel off the sweat while you may.",
  "250408": "It will help your exiguous business along.",
  "250409": "I don't expect this favour will be repaid.",
  "250410": "You would be joining an elite club.",
  "250411": "You never had anything I needed.",
  "250412": "We always throw your junk into the sea.",
  "250413": "Why I degraded myself to your level...!",
  "250418": "Who would decline a match with a von Malching?",
  "250419": "A most illustrious alliance, surely?",
  "250420": "I am so tired of pretending to care about you.",
  "250421": "We are patently not on the same footing.",
  "250427": "Take it. I hardly need it.",
  "250428": "Had it coming out of my ears - wax free, of course.",
  "250429": "Here is a token gift.",
  "250438": "For once something you've done makes sense.",
  "250439": "That's not a terrible idea.",
  "250440": "Oh, yes...",
  "250441": "Most promising.",
  "250442": "Surprisingly shrewd ...",
  "250443": "Vagabond!",
  "250444": "Tatterdemalion!",
  "250445": "A bold-faced swindle!",
  "250446": "The impudence!",
  "250447": "A low-life move.",
  "250448": "By Jove, you're a maniac!",
  "250449": "Your paper tigers will be blown to the winds.",
  "250450": "War? All too obvious, you sneeze-lurking snake.",
  "250451": "Finally worked out who's best?",
  "250452": "I suppose I could spare you ...",
  "250453": "I could have batty-fanged you to bits.",
  "250454": "Yes, I do think you need time to recuperate.",
  "250455": "Fine, though I doubt you have anything tradeworthy.",
  "250456": "I keenly await your first shipment of soiled 'k'chiefs.",
  "250457": "Trade with you? Lucky me.",
  "250458": "No more of your junk? Say it's not true!",
  "250459": "Finally we can be rid of your detritus!",
  "250460": "Yes, go back to the foot of the pyramid.",
  "250465": "Certainly I can be a friend, at least on paper.",
  "250466": "Dry your eyes, I will be your ally.",
  "250467": "Weaselling your way out?",
  "250468": "Sloping your shoulders?",

  "250520": "I've always dreamed of being loathed!",
  "250521": "Au contraire! There is nothing more in fashion than the monocle!",
  "250522": "Your guttural babble sloshes like water off a duck's back!",
  "250523": "The wayward jabs of your sabre are foiled by your lack of poise.",
  "250524": "What sticky drippy honey goop!",
  "250525": "Damn liberal! Control your peculiar thoughts!",
  "250526": "What a fawning cod you have turned out to be.",
  "250527": "Your toadyism is thoroughly nauseating!",
  "250528": "Lies and slander! My wife died in a curricle accident!",
  "250529": "I am nothing like my idiot father! You calumniating imp!",
  "250530": "What's wrong with my moustache?!",
  "250545": "I AM a real baron, I tell you!",
  "250531": "Oh, yes. Couldn't have said it better myself.",
  "250532": "Thank you! Pleasingly round isn't it?",
  "250533": "Very true! They are extremely shiny.",
  "250534": "I know your game of billiards, but don't let me stop you.",
  "254923": "I'm confident I can still exploit you in some way.",
  "254924": "You might hold potential yields.",
  "254925": "There's something about you, gullibility perhaps.",
  "254926": "I'm convinced you sit on a gold mine, that could be my mine.",
  "254927": "Awful to think you might have nobody to confide in.",
  "254928": "The closer we are, the more likely I am to inherit.",
  "254929": "You have a whiff of innocence.",
  "254930": "You know, we're so close, I'm almost in your pocket.",
  "254931": "Why am I letting you near me!?",
  "254932": "What was I thinking!",
  "254933": "I'm disturbed you managed to lure me in.",
  "254934": "Who needs family?",
  "254935": "I believe you'd slow my runaway train!",
  "254936": "So what if I am deeply prejudiced?",
  "254937": "I've just been delving into your heritage.",
  "254938": "What feeble creature is that on your coat-of-arms?",
  "265586": "You rub shoulders with the elite.",
  "265587": "You have to butter some muffins on the way to the top.",
  "265589": "Look at you worms tangling in the mud.",
  "265590": "I don't like them, and I don't like you.",
  "265592": "You humiliate yourself publicly!",
  "265593": "It doesn't suit you to mingle with the upper crust.",
  "265595": "Yes, there can only be one showmaster!",
  "265596": "I love to see others squabbling among themselves.",
  "265588": "Partridge-napper! That is my secret tunnel!",
  "265594": "Imagine! Living a life of duplicity!",
  "265591": "It would be naive not to keep an eye on them.",
  "265597": "Everyone's doing it, are they not?",
  "256611": "Who do you bribe to make such advances?!",
  "256612": "What is this radicalism?",
  "256613": "Best hope that ladder isn't swiped under you!",
  "256616": "You've come a long way— heaven knows you needed to.",
  "256617": "Well, well, look at the surging hoi polloi!",
  "256618": "Further strides toward the unexceptional!",
  "256621": "Squatter! I won't sue you, I'll ruin you!",
  "256622": "Hornswoggling your way in?!",
  "256623": "You rock-suckling barnacle!",
  "257061": "I am a baron! Land is for me to own.",
  "257062": "Fiend, stop grabbing it all!",
  "256624": "I am the eagle, who swoops for juicy bits.",
  "256625": "A miniscule gain, you must be very proud.",
  "256626": "Can't see why that land was so enticing.",
  "257063": "Must have been awfully cramped before…",
  "257064": "What entitlement could you possibly hold?!",
  "250572": "I bought some of your island. The door was open, and I ambled through.",
  "250573": "Hardly worth investing in your island, but then, it won't be yours for long.",
  "250574": "A delicious morsel. Soon I shall have the lion's share.",
  "250575": "It can be mine now. All mine.",
  "250576": "I have so many grand plans for it…",
  "250577": "A completely insignificant island, no wonder you're so keen to buy!",
  "250578": "You can afford to tussle for my island? Perhaps I underestimated you.",
  "250579": "Only a fastidious cove thinks they can buy their way in!",
  "250580": "You think you've outmanoeuvred me!",
  "250581": "Defraud me of an entire island?!",
  "250582": "Sad you lack the acumen to see the potential of this land.",
  "250583": "What kind of apple-polisher gives up an island?",
  "250586": "You only have it because I let you have it!",
  "250587": "You do the hard work developing it, and then I'll take it back.",
  "250590": "You philistine! All my hard work gone from that island.",
  "250591": "You erased every trace of von Malching from it?! Savage!",
  "250592": "Razed every brick I laid? You are possessed by sadistic demons!",
  "250620": "I'll smithereen you!",
  "250621": "Lowly cur!",
  "250622": "Have at you, devil-dog!",
  "250623": "I'm positively bristling!",
  "250624": "I am suddenly violent!",
  "250625": "You wild beast!",
  "250626": "You vindictive menace!",
  "250627": "Your fleet is a rabble!",
  "250628": "Plebs are not at liberty to joust!",
  "250629": "Knave!",
  "250630": "Oh dear, did your stock plummet?",
  "250631": "I shall sweep your wreck for treasure!",
  "250632": "Your tin-pot tars left clinging to driftwood!",
  "250633": "That ship cost me an arm and a leg!",
  "250634": "My ship! You electric eel!",
  "250635": "Where did you find such firepower?",
  "250636": "I should have charged the spectators!",
  "250637": "It gave way so easily!",
  "250638": "Have you any idea how much that cost?",
  "250639": "That will be sickeningly expensive to replace!",
  "250640": "Look at my winning smile!",
  "250641": "It's my island now. Time to exploit the dissidents!",
  "250678": "Brute force?! A fearful determination.",
  "250679": "You didn't play fair! This wretched life is never fair.",
  "250642": "Oh no. Looks like I've trampled over you on my way to the top of the pile.",
  "250643": "Nowhere left to run for the von Malching line. Be my surrogate, show them all... how to run a cut-throat business.",
  "250644": "They were a valued business associate!",
  "250645": "Don't rub out my allies! They could be useful!",
  "250646": "You take care of my enemies, and I'll make mountains.",
  "250647": "Yes, you create a distraction while I fill my pockets.",
  "250648": "I had you down as a lily-livered waif.",
  "250649": "Rash. You almost have my respect.",
  "250650": "A military gambit now?",
  "250651": "Yes. Better to send your plebs to war.",
  "250652": "I hear your officers call you 'pipsqueak'.",
  "250653": "Playing tin soldiers?",
  "250654": "You polish your blunderbuss like a pimpled cadet.",
  "250655": "The bluster of a shoe-laced ruffian.",
  "250656": "Honour our agreement, drive back these scoundrels!",
  "250657": "You would not dare renege on our pact!?",
  "261320": "I declared war on your friend; guarantee they will be your friend no longer!",
  "250658": "Come at the drop of a hat? Only if I get a share of the spoils.",
  "250659": "This feels like a first for me; honouring a deal I made.",
  "250660": "Foxed your way into my hole!? Where's my rifle?",
  "250661": "You'll soon be back here before a firing squad!",
  "250662": "Enough meaningless talk, let's see how rich you are in a duel!",
  "250663": "My slick sailors will string yours from their sails!",
  "250664": "One fish in the vast school that will bring you to your patchwork knees!",
  "250665": "These majestic cannons will shred your rag-tag sails.",
  "256014": "That's it, show those greasy plebs what for!",
  "256015": "Should be lined up for what they've done!",
  "256016": "Disease?! And you seem to be its source.",
  "256017": "I knew there was something putrescent about you.",
  "256825": "How can so few words be so distracting?!",
  "256826": "How do you fashion such alluring sentences?!",
  "256827": "I want to bait them away from the truth!",
  "256789": "Why waste it all on plebs, indeed!",
  "256790": "I believe in hoarding too.",
  "256791": "So easy to dupe them, isn't it?",
  "256792": "I find newsprint is more than enough for them to chew on.",
  "256793": "The suggestible pleb believes anything they read.",
  "256794": "A few sheets of pulp, and the gutter is satisfied!",
  "256834": "Then there is such a thing as bad publicity.",
  "256835": "Do you not find these stories remotely embarrassing?",
  "256836": "Have you seen the news, you are a laughing stock!",
  "265856": "How dare you assail the noble Bente!",
  "265858": "About time someone crunched that locust!",
  "265860": "You know, that filthy sewer rat has a mean bite.",
  "265868": "You too would like her favour, eh?",
  "265870": "Two feathered twits bumping around the same coop.",
  "265872": "Her sordid dynasty is somehow worthy of credit, isn't it?",
  "267997": "Look at all those helpless beasts, ha ha!",
  "267998": "Where did you source all of those gleaming exhibits?",
  "267999": "You can't get succeed without getting a little soot on your hands!",
  "268001": "They shouldn't be happy they should be in the gutter!",
  "268002": "If they have time to mope, they have time to work!",
  "268003": "Now you can exploit them somewhere else!",
  "268004": "How far do you think being so nice is going to get you?",
  "268005": "Squeeze out every last drop!",
  "268006": "Potted plants and soft furnishings? What a waste!",
  "261164": "Father failed you too, did he? You'll want to restore your family's soiled name.",
  "261165": "Edvard's right, where is our royal fleet commission?",
  "267919": "They probably did it for money—I would.",
  "267920": "You would tell me if you discovered El Doo-dah out there, wouldn't you?",
  "261166": "Of course, only a fool would have let Prosperity slip in the first place. The clue is in the name!",
  "261167": "Family only ever hold us back.",
  "266592": "You unstoppered the bottle and let the menace loose!",
  "266593": "I was worried for a while there would be no Queen to grant me my baroncy.",
  "261448": "Dabbling in disorganised crime?!",
  "261449": "Who do you think you are, the scarlet pimple-nel?",
  "261450": "Industrial sabotage!",
  "261451": "Bamboozle me?!",
  "261452": "Your blind mice have lost their tails!",
  "261453": "How the devil did you find out!?",
  "261454": "That is business these days.",
  "261455": "Can't you see, everyone has spies!",
  "261456": "Take my deception as a compliment!",
  "261457": "No! No!! The fool was caught!",
  "261458": "Your scientific dabbling is paying off.",
  "261459": "Your science fixation doesn't look so freakish now!",
  "261460": "Your ghoulish experimentations bear sublime fruit.",
  "261461": "I should have the most fecund laboratories!",
  "261462": "Why aren't my squares that brilliant?!",
  "261463": "I want to profit from the scientific sphere!",
  "266445": "How do you both look?",
  "266446": "Oh, that! I like to wear it in private.",
  "266447": "Poppycock! Don’t be such a prude. How do you know I haven’t been wearing a tutu all along? You only ever see my top half in-game.",
  "266448": "What does everyone have against mein tutu? I think it’s time you all took stock... / I hereby solemnly confess: / I wear a pink tutu / From late at night till morning dew / I wear a pink tutu / I wear a pink tutu. / Yes, thank heaven above! / Avoid me, belittle me / but oh how it flatters me / And it fits like a glove. / I wear a pink tutu. / In contempt of my character rules / When I appear, It’s true / I wear most certainly / Something beneath made of tulle / I wear a pink tutu. / So before you begin to pooh-pooh / take time to scrutinise / please try to recognise / That I wear a tutu",
  "266449": "No I refuse to be quiet / Now everything’s out in the light / If in the loading screen, the harbour, / or in the trading menu / forever I’ll wear a tutu!",
  "266450": "Good, then we can begin.",
  "266451": "I did not know the queen was part of this. I thought we cut that witch out?",

  "266453": "quite feeble and small",

  "266457": "No!",
  "266458": "A shame he has taken it so badly. He thinks anno is so boring—he was really looking forward to the musical.",
  "266459": "He simply clicks fast forward!",
  "266460": "Then he fasts forward!",
  "266461": "They all fast forward!",
  "266462": "We fast forward, and forward…",
  "266463": "No, wait. Something’s wrong. The lighting should be different somehow. The sun should be…",
  "266464": "Where’s the ambulance?",
  "266465": "No name to set things straight / The concept is rather hard to relate",
  "266466": "Anyone have a light?",
  "266467": "No! mein tutu! / Oh horror! Oh pain! / All we see is made of paper!",
  "266468": "All of it burns, the air runs out. Will this bring our doom about?",
  "266469": "All of it burns, my pink tutu!",
  "266470": "Everything burns, everything smokes. / Where have all the coders gone, / When the need provokes.",
  "250072": "Some find it titillating to serve. Is that you?",

  "251881": "A feast day!",
  "251882": "Is ecstasy.",

  "267159": "Father would never have! He was the Queen's stalwart, a member of the Royal Council, he...",
  "264970": "Help enough to demolish the larger ruins. Let's breathe some life into this place!",
  "264971": "Father wouldn't have wanted us to sit on our hands while our one prospect was in such a state.",
  "264972": "So let's gather our townsfolk and ask them to spruce the place up.",
  "264973": "Mourning is eased, now we have others for company, sibling.",
  "264974": "Your people are recovered, and desirous to proceed. Set them to it! We're going to need as much space as we can clear.",
  "264979": "Let Uncle Edvard scoff. A modest island yes, but if you’re at all like Father, you’ll look beyond appearances.",
  "265063": "We are running low on timber, but there's plenty in the ruins. We should clear some to stock up.",
  "264976": "We must shelter the good, loyal people who have shown solidarity with our family.",
  "264977": "We need every hand we can get if we are to expunge this debris.",
  "264978": "It's been a hard day of labour for us all, we should cater to our tired, hungry people!",
  "264980": "Timber, very good. I’ll try not to think of the coffin.",
  "264981": "He twists every article in his favour, at our and father’s expense!",
  "265041": "See what slander Edvard prints in Bright Sands!",
  "266512": "If only father were here, he'd have known what to do.",
  "266515": "It is not nearly as moribund here as it was.",
  "266516": "Those still loyal to Father will now turn to you.",
  "266517": "A moving tribute to see so many loyal to father trust in you.",
  "266518": "At such times it is good to occupy oneself with routine things.",
  "266519": "I'm sure you know, but father was innocent.",
  "266520": "We must behave as if father were acquitted, as one day he will be.",
  "266521": "Aarhant is proving wise counsel. I'm glad you managed to make a friend while you were away.",
  "266522": "In times such as these, it is good to have people around us.",
  "266523": "I'll dream of Bright Sands until the day I can dream no more.",
  "264988": "You have father’s fortitude! These people will follow you as they once followed him.",
  "264998": "Is there no limit to Uncle's shameless demands?",
  "264999": "I feel sick to the stomach that Edvard could ask so much of us so soon after father's death.",
  "265000": "Miserly, uncharitable… dastard! Picking and choosing what he inherits!",
  "265050": "Clearly Uncle's intention is to keep us from ever owning a shipyard.",
  "264990": "Speak to our humble cousin! He writes of a worker riot in Bright Sands.",
  "264991": "It seems we are not alone in our contempt for Edvard.",
  "265053": "Our dream of a shipyard is impossible without plenty of qualified hands.",
  "265054": "Workers can handle stubborn debris on Ditchwater. If it's to be the centre of our new enterprise it needs to be immaculate.",
  "265055": "Maybe Edvard will try to prevent us owning a shipyard, but for now let's at least house those workers.",
  "264994": "Even I am astonished he could be this corrupt. We must put their cases before the highest authority, and hope for a retrial.",
  "265002": "It cannot be...these names are those father trusted most; barristers, doctors, academics.",
  "265003": "However much we despise Uncle Edvard, it's criminal to go opening his private correspondence!",
  "264995": "I am so relieved our legitimacy is no longer in question.",
  "264997": "Hurry, I already smell the tar, see the masts a-swaying from father’s study!",
  "264989": "We have to set personal feelings aside and do as Edvard asks.",
  "266583": "Edvard becomes a monster inconceivably grotesque, but one we, for now must keep fed.",
  "266584": "As this letter proves them innocent, let us hurry to Sir Archibald.",
  "266585": "For almost the first time since he passed, eldest, my heart is lifted.",
  "266586": "Building a shipyard is no small matter, our work is far from finsihed.",
  "266587": "Father would be ashamed to see his brother now.",
  "266588": "I shall not be content with any ship, until I can say it is one we ourselves have built.",
  "266589": "The ship is another serendipity we should be grateful for.",
  "266197": "A commission for the Royal fleet! And in such quantity! A rare honour indeed!",
  "266198": "I find myself looking up to you, as the youngest often will.",
  "266202": "The weaponry they ask for presents a problem. I'm not even sure we have an iron lode, do we?",
  "266207": "I see the iron is beyond our reach. We have no choice but to find a way through the mountain.",
  "266206": "What are you both doing?! Demolition is a serious matter, wanting proper expertise!",
  "266205": "Father used Mr. Ticker on account of his good sense. Go on, I suggest you find him in Bright Sands.",
  "266204": "Ah, he’s here! Try to make a good first impression, eldest; any friend of father is a friend of ours.",
  "266224": "Iron into Steel, Steel into Arms and we shall have fulfilled our first Royal commission!",
  "266225": "There is no shame in producing weapons if it is in defence of the realm, eldest.",
  "266767": "Granting such a prestigious commission shows the council may be willing to give us fair hearing.",
  "266768": "The last moneys I spent on Ditchwater appear well spent, eldest—and the faith I invested in you.",
  "266769": "This could be the start of something significant for us.",
  "266770": "I'm sure if we have iron deposits, you can find them, eldest.",
  "266771": "If the royal fleet is to be at the cutting edge, we must start producing steel.",
  "266772": "Steel! How proud father would be.",
  "266773": "You have put in as much hard work as anyone else!",
  "266774": "To outfit our ships, we're going to need to fashion all that steel into weaponry.",
  "266775": "Perhaps we should sell ships to partners father trusted.",
  "266776": "I predict inexhaustible demand for our steel!",
  "266777": "We are the beating heart of industry in the Empire.",
  "266778": "Exactly the sort of mischief I remember you by.",
  "266779": "Mr. Ticker has years of experience in detonations, we must secure his services.",
  "266780": "Who would kill such a gentle man? Why?",
  "266215": "I knew all along Father could never have taken his own life. But that someone willfully took his...!",
  "266242": "It is father's diary! Quickly, what does he say!?",
  "266243": "Of course, the island over which he was accused of treason! That is what they are after.",
  "266246": "The diary may not be enough in itself to convince Sir Archibald, but it may give him food for thought.",
  "266247": "No doubt father thought this symbol germane. If anyone can interpret it, Madame Kahina can.",
  "266260": "Sarmento's last location is all we have. We need to plan our expedition route carefully.",
  "266860": "You look into this, eldest. I'm not sure I can face it.",
  "266874": "This is what we wanted after all. To know the truth.",
  "266875": "What could he have meant, eldest? I fear this mystery is only just begun.",
  "266876": "I now have more questions than answers.",
  "266877": "Father's killer was a nobody. Something greater conspires against our family.",
  "266878": "Oh we are swept up in something now, eldest. And I am coming with you…",
  "266879": "I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering such mysteries.",
  "266880": "I wonder if Sir Archibald knows of this Pyrphorian threat? I think we have enough here to beg his consideration again…",
  "266882": "Where is the contract that would be official proof of Prosperity's sale?",
  "266883": "Be careful, eldest.",
  "266884": "It relates the sale of the island Prosperity—the very reason father was branded a traitor.",
  "266885": "We cannot let the truth sink into the murk!",
  "266886": "Father’s own hand! Now we shall know his mind, eldest.",
  "266887": "Don’t be afraid to ask Madame Kahina, she became a good friend to father.",
  "266888": "Kahina is acquainted with the new world, she is sure to have seen this symbol before.",
  "266889": "All we have is Isabel’s last-known hideaway, and a world of unknowns in between.",
  "266890": "Prosperity is the cause of all this trouble. I already despise that wretched place.",
  "266891": "I can think of no better than father's old friend Kahina, when it comes to pondering mysteries.",
  "266892": "If you are going to do this, I am coming with you.",
  "266893": "At last the expedition has found Miss Sarmento. Let us hope she makes our journey worthwhile.",
  "267000": "I'll do anything to know the truth, even if it mean dealing with Isabel's rogues.",
  "267010": "As it stands, they are an easy target for the Pyrphorians. We should help, eldest.",
  "267011": "You have done more to protect her people than Isabel could possibly have hoped, eldest.",
  "267012": "From what we know of the Pyrphorians, I don't think it's enough yet to deter them.",
  "267013": "Prosperity—I want to see the island that caused all this with my own eyes.",
  "267014": "Then the Pyrphorians wanted Prosperity for the oil. No doubt to keep their fires burning.",
  "267015": "I think we can ask anything of Isabel with her people sheltered, defended and now supplied.",
  "267016": "This is about as much as she can ask for.",
  "267017": "Isabel is showing genuine gratitude. Perhaps she isn't the sort I thought.",
  "267018": "For the first time in my life, I know freedom.",
  "267019": "Isabel claims to know the whereabouts of the contract, and it is the only trail we have.",
  "267020": "I am so glad we are finally seeing the world together, eldest.",
  "267021": "There it is— Prosperity. The source of all our troubles.",
  "267022": "These fires cannot be due to the warm climate.",
  "267023": "The firemen confirm it was arson! These fires were set upon us!",
  "267024": "This monstrous fire-raising is deliberate. The Pyrphorians!",
  "267025": "Isabel is mistaken. I won't hear these lies about father.",
  "267026": "Why has Isabel not yet given us the Prosperity contract? She is worryingly elusive on the subject.",
  "267027": "Isabel plays on our emotions. Still, if the sick could be carried to La Isla to convalesce…",
  "267028": "A messenger boy has brought us a letter.",
  "267029": "It is in Isabel's interest we find that contract! The Queen will realise Sarmento was forced into the deal.",
  "267242": "I'm no more experienced in espionage than you, eldest. But this is our one chance to uncover the truth.",
  "267264": "We have to make this count. That contract will reveal all.",
  "267265": "You have it! I never knew you had the ingenuity!",
  "267266": "It is father's signature, but in Edvard's hand! Edvard was behind this!",
  "267267": "I believe Sir Archibald when he says Her Majesty may do something drastic.",
  "267268": "Well done Eldest! You have served both Isabel and the Empire greatly.",
  "267269": "If this is the only way to get to the truth, then we must follow it.",
  "267270": "I know it's only paperwork, but the Pyrphorians cannot operate if The Empire owns Prosperity again.",
  "267271": "Isabel was true to her word in the end. You have to admire her shrewdness.",
  "267272": "I realise Isabel means well.",
  "267273": "If Aarhant were here, I'm sure he'd have some good advice.",
  "267274": "To forge father's signature! Edvard must have been possessed!",
  "267275": "I would have been right to strike Edvard's cheek, the many times I had the inclination!",
  "267276": "I will not rest until Edvard sees justice, even if I must escort him to the gallows myself!",
  "267277": "As Edvard is paraded to the town square, I want to be there in the front row.",
  "267504": "Edvard was the cause of all our grief! To see his face when he discovers we know!",
  "267519": "We confront Edvard this instant! I have so very many words for him!",
  "267520": "Cast iron will make it very difficult for him to sidle away!",
  "267521": "I will indulge not one of the thousand apologies I presume he has ready.",
  "267522": "We should do what we can to get the evidence in order. No need to engage with Edvard.",
  "267523": "The Queen wants the trial to be an occasion. We better make sure we're ready.",
  "267524": "The evidence at such a high-profile inquiry must be absolutely watertight.",
  "267525": "Finally we can have our revenge on Edvard for all he has done.",
  "267526": "Leave no stone unturned. Who knows if Edvard has kept back other nasty surprises for us.",
  "267527": "Now we are ready for Her Majesty. All the eyes of the world will be upon us.",
  "267528": "If the Queen wants to make a big song and dance of the trial, we better see to it.",
  "267529": "The Queen's visit, not the trial, may be the greatest occasion of your people's lives.",
  "267530": "I don't know what I would do without you, eldest.",
  "267531": "Everything comes under scrutiny in the presence of royalty.",
  "267532": "Edvard is as good as dead to me.",
  "267533": "I will not look at him at the trial.",
  "267534": "Concentrate on securing a verdict for Edvard!",
  "267535": "You were out there in paradise, and I dragged you into all this. I'm sorry.",
  "267536": "You are the one positive in all of this. No sister could have asked for more.",
  "267537": "Is this business really nearly over, eldest? I don't feel any better for all we've dug up.",
  "267538": "I should have seen through it. Saved father while I had the chance.",
  "267674": "You cannot allow Bright Sands to be subjugated! Our childhood home!",
  "267695": "Bright Sands! You must save them!",
  "267696": "Uncle Edvard… He’s suffered enough, eldest. I believe I can forgive him now.",
  "267697": "Now we are all that remains, eldest. I intend to take strength from that.",
  "267698": "We will not give in to terror! Never!",
  "267699": "We must avenge Edvard—the only way we can, father.",
  "267700": "Come what may, I am not afraid.",
  "267701": "There is only one way left, eldest.",
  "267702": "What you did goes far beyond us, dear blood. You have saved us all from a reign of terror.",
  "267703": "It shall be a proper funeral. Let us reunite the two brothers, side-by-side. Once and for all, confine the past to the past.",
  "267704": "We must bury them both together in the family tomb.",
  "267705": "Let us talk once Samuel and Edvard have taken their rightful place side by side.",
  "267706": "I do not feel any more sadness, eldest. The clouds have lifted—azure skies lie beyond.",
  "267707": "Have joy in your heart as you make these final arrangements.",
  "267708": "They will not have Bright Sands!",
  "267709": "Another glimmer! Isabel fights beside us.",
  "267710": "They will not stop you, eldest. Lead us forth!",
  "267711": "Fires rage everywhere! We must unmask these arsonists before its too late!",
  "267712": "The arsonists must be intercepted!",
  "267725": "There will be nothing left of the city if the arsonists remain on the prowl!",
  "267713": "Now the fires are out of control, and the arsonists still loose!",
  "267714": "Quickly, the civilians! I won't see them swept up in the fighting!",
  "267715": "Bright Sands is no place for civilians! We must come to their rescue!",
  "267716": "Find a way to extract them unnoticed!",
  "267717": "Poor, poor Edvard!",
  "267718": "Edvard was ready to make peace with himself at the end.",
  "267719": "Father always wanted you to have Bright Sands. The past cannot hold you any more.",
  "267720": "Edvard died far better than he lived. He is forgiven.",
  "267721": "If father had but held Edvard—shown his affection.",
  "267722": "When I come here, I bring only cattails—for peace and prosperity.",
  "267723": "These stones are not cold, but warm. The sun is shining again.",
  "267724": "The past may be buried but it is not forgotten.",
  "257903": "Ready to follow them secretly?",
  "258067": "Here's a thing, eldest. Please be punctual.",
  "258068": "Most people would jump at this chance.",
  "258069": "It would be a compelling task for anyone.",
  "258070": "I wonder if you can find it within yourself—helping your little sister?",
  "258071": "Of course this business is far too lively for me...",
  "258072": "I shall attend other errands meanwhile.",
  "258073": "Don't feel you have to do this as a courtesy to me.",
  "258074": "I shall await you by cheerily sifting through paper.",
  "258075": "I always appreciate your help, however overdue.",
  "258076": "Rare for promises to be kept, thank you.",
  "258077": "You restore a grain of my trust in humanity, eldest.",
  "258078": "I'm not going to say I didn't think it possible.",
  "258079": "Eldest, you outdo yourself.",
  "258080": "Given up? That is the luxury of inconstancy.",
  "258081": "As you wish, after all I managed without you before.",
  "258085": "I'm sure you did your utmost.",
  "258086": "I doubt there is anything more you could have done.",
  "258087": "It's alright, I didn't expect it would go very well.",
  "258088": "I dream of some kind of news.",
  "258089": "I can ask, but after that it is up to you.",
  "258090": "Am I to understand my petition goes unheard?",
  "258091": "Every duty you fulfil will help others build trust in you.",
  "258092": "Why, not one, but several prospects in quick succession!",
  "258093": "Another appointment, when will the excitement end!?",
  "258094": "Eldest, if you have any heart at all...I am your kith and kin.",
  "258095": "Could you really have it on your conscience?",
  "258096": "Dare I believe it is good news you bring?",
  "258097": "Tidings, fair or foul?",
  "258098": "Speak to me, I am ready for the worst.",
  "258099": "Nothing but paperwork to be done...",
  "258100": "There's no work for you...",
  "258101": "Nothing new on the horizon...",
  "260048": "I am somewhat heartened.",
  "260059": "I am more hopeful than I was.",
  "260060": "All seems well for now.",
  "260061": "Signs are more encouraging.",
  "260062": "Times must be good.",
  "260063": "I shouldn't complain at times like these.",
  "260064": "All quite bearable.",
  "260075": "I'm happy for you, really I am.",
  "260076": "You might feel rather pleased with yourself.",
  "260077": "You've kept things in good order.",
  "260078": "No-one can begrudge your achievements.",
  "260079": "You have not been unsuccessful!",
  "260080": "Your dedication is commendable.",
  "260081": "You work with reassuring method.",
  "260082": "This grim monotony is worse than life.",
  "260083": "I should like to be someone else.",
  "260084": "Sigh...",
  "260085": "I find this all so trivial.",
  "260086": "How dull.",
  "260087": "I want to feel something, just not irritable!",
  "260088": "I'm tired of being tired.",
  "260089": "You give me no comfort at present.",
  "260090": "I worried you might be this sort of person.",
  "260091": "You forget yourself.",
  "260092": "A quaint interpretation of precision.",
  "260093": "When you overlook minutiaie, things go awry.",
  "260094": "And it's all the harder when one is alone!",
  "260095": "It's a disordered tangle of briar.",
  "258149": "Then you are the long lost sibling. Hallo. I hope we can come to know one another a little.",
  "258150": "I never thought I'd see you again, sibling. I hope your return coincides with better times.",
  "258151": "Hallo dear.",
  "258152": "You've returned.",
  "258153": "I've been holding fort, as ever.",
  "258154": "Father was given to inquiry.",
  "258156": "You seem to come and go as you please.",
  "258155": "I did wonder if you'd come by.",
  "258157": "Nothing new here, I'm afraid.",
  "260232": "Perhaps a change of fortunes.",
  "260233": "Well, I shan't be an ingrate.",
  "260234": "A thank you is probably in order.",
  "260235": "Oh what does it matter either way...",
  "260236": "What else can I do but accept...",
  "260237": "Then it shall be so...",
  "261112": "If only I had the invitingly empty sort of paper for writing, not lined, for accounting.",
  "261113": "Fictions only remind me how little of my own writing I've done lately.",
  "261114": "If ever I seem far away, remember so were you, those long years.",
  "261115": "One should get to know one's kin, shouldn't one?",
  "261116": "Getting things done bright and early maintains discipline for the remaining day.",
  "261117": "After a jam scone at teatime, I feel a different person. That is to say, a sympathetic one.",
  "261118": "I can't see how any woman finds calisthenics remotely emancipating.",
  "261119": "I have to make do with living vicariously through your exploits.",
  "260238": "No indeed!",
  "260239": "I can't let it happen.",
  "260240": "Really this is too much.",
  "268121": "I have discovered some inefficiencies we ought to address...",
  "268122": "Our business is being adversely affected by urgent matters we ought to resolve...",
  "268123": "Here is a matter of the utmost importance, we must knock it on the head!",
  "268124": "There is a defect in the economic machine that you ought to correct...",
  "268125": "A concern has raised its ugly head, that I don't think can wait...",
  "268131": "Oh, this is terrible! We have to save the situation in any way we can!",
  "268095": "Every settlement needs a market. The people want a place for supplies, provide it!",
  "268096": "I checked the manifests. Not all our facilities are able to deliver the goods they produce. Please correct the situation!",
  "268098": "Our settlement is rather small. You will have to attract more farmers if you want to make progress.",
  "268101": "The farmers are hungry. You'll have to supply them with the necessary, starting with fish.",
  "268102": "Everything you've built so far consumed wood. We'll be needing more of it to continue.",
  "268103": "I've been going over the accounts. There is no denying it, we're close to bankruptcy! Avert this disaster!",
  "268105": "The land can only be farmed if there are enough fields. We must plant them!",
  "268106": "Work is going unfinished. We must ensure we have sufficient workforce to finish it!",
  "268107": "We are missing a vital good that cannot be produced on our island. You will have to find a way to import it!",
  "268108": "You have prepared everything. Now is the time to advance by settling the first workers!",
  "268110": "Without electricity some facilities won't run. You have to set up the preliminaries to get them going!",
  "268119": "Our docks are primed for a first ship launch! Everyone waits on your signal!",
  "268120": "Our city is noteworthy enough to attract its first visitors. We must be sure to make all the necessary arrangements!",
  "268093": "Numbers, accounts, indices. What might otherwise be a worry to you are my affairs. I'll stay close by in case you should need support.",
  "266616": "Since that day you saved my life, I have presumed I knew you. But now...",
  "254662": "A thousand letters from your father go unopened, yet one scribble from your sister changes everything? I didn't even know you had a sister!",
  "266665": "We are broke, old pal! We can’t afford a passage back to your old world, back to your family! Not unless you’ve suddenly remembered what work is.",
  "254663": "So this is it. We're leaving paradise behind. You never talked much about family and the like, but you’re dead serious about this, aren’t you? No matter, I made a vow to defend you. And I don't break an oath, even if a blind man could see you leap into the deepest pit of dung.",
  "253931": "All those houses! You never said how wealthy you were. Why were we selling fish and sleeping in barns?!",
  "253932": "Looks like death claimed the wrong brother.",
  "253933": "Your sister reminds me of you. Must mean new adventures await, old pal.",
  "266721": "Now that sounds like good news.",
  "266732": "Who are all these busybodies? Blowing up rocks can't be that complicated!",
  "266733": "Ha ha! My apologies - that was indeed impressive! Is there anything dynamite won't solve, I wonder?",
  "266946": "Look! Devils from below breathing fire and flame!",
  "266947": "We are not afraid of cowards hiding behind masks.",
  "266948": "Their fleet is formidable. I count many ships.",
  "267006": "Yes, just look at her. I bet she's already forgotten who we are.",
  "267007": "They are at peace now.",
  "267008": "...the Queen. She's the Queen.",
  "267009": "After all we've been through?",
  "267142": "Liar! You are the picture of regret!",
  "267143": "You don't understand pain. Real pain.",
  "267150": "We're nearing the place your father died. Whatever happens, stay calm!",
  "267151": "We didn't come here to be insulted, we came to strike a bargain. The demolitions man Thomas, we want him.",
  "264982": "It’s been a long, hard day. The people need to rest. And maybe wet their whistles.",
  "266524": "A cloud still hangs over this place, please make it go away!",
  "266525": "She has you doing all those chores you tried to leave behind.",
  "266526": "Everything depends on this enterprise for your sister, I won't watch you let her down.",
  "266527": "You're better with humankind than I used to believe.",
  "266528": "First the weather, now the people!",
  "266529": "It is not rain, but wet mist! And endless! What are we doing here?!",
  "266530": "Disrespectful chatter abounds about your father and how he died.",
  "266531": "Sometimes feels like your sister hardly knows you.",
  "266532": "The tin rush left this island ugly.",
  "266533": "Funny to watch you get your hands dirty.",
  "266534": "So serious all of a sudden. Where’s that old spirit of yours gone?",
  "265004": "He certainly knows how to silence his critics.",
  "265005": "A letter. It bears Edvard’s seal!",
  "265056": "Open the letter, he's clearly up to no good!",
  "266606": "Though the burden is lifted, Edvard will keep you headlocked for life if you allow him to.",
  "266607": "Edvard has shown his weakness as a leader. We must exploit it.",
  "266608": "This is our chance to show Edvard who rules the waves.",
  "266609": "Sometimes doing the wrong thing is the right thing, old pal.",
  "266610": "Why would we need a licence to build a boat? Seems that's how it is here...",
  "266611": "Once this shipyard is built, we can gesture rudely at Edvard, and go back to adventuring.",
  "266612": "She says it's ''your'' shipyard? Does that mean we're going to be here forever?",
  "266613": "All I smell on your Uncle is greed.",
  "266614": "Don’t grovel for your Uncle. He has no power over you.",
  "266615": "You do know Edvard has no intention of lifting that debt?",
  "266203": "Still have a few sticks of dynamite! We can blow our way through!",
  "266208": "Mr. Ticker has opened my eyes to the world of controlled destruction!",
  "266209": "Perhaps not refined enough for your sister, but at least your workers can start their dig.",
  "266781": "Always dangerous, getting wrapped-up in the business of a Queen.",
  "266795": "My bond is to you, not to your monarch.",
  "266796": "You're part of it now, just like your father was.",
  "266797": "Once you reach the top, there's only one way from there.",
  "266798": "I'm still waiting for the boom!",
  "266799": "I suppose it is better to let the experts handle it.",
  "266800": "My sword is fashioned from Ukku steel, but to produce in these quantities!",
  "266801": "This steel will command great value.",
  "266802": "I never imagined a city could grow so fast.",
  "266803": "You're a real fat cat now! Hope you remember one day how you got here…",
  "266804": "The workers may as well start preparing for the detonation.",
  "266805": "Admit it, you’d never have hired a demolition expert in the old days.",
  "266806": "Fizzle, fizzle, boom! Hahaha.",
  "266807": "The way to the iron mines is clear!",
  "266808": "Perhaps you can help me understand who keeps a murder under their hat? Forgive me, I know we speak of your father…",
  "266216": "The foul scent of a killer. We cannot let him escape.",
  "266217": "Someone supplies the murderer from Madame Kahina's harbour? We should investigate.",
  "266228": "The locals say that trading ship over there belongs to a stranger. Maybe that's the supplier!",
  "266240": "He freely admits to his crime! Get him!",
  "266241": "No, he is dead! It cannot end here, we have no answers!",
  "266248": "There must be some clue among the wreckage, anything!",
  "266249": "It's empty!",
  "266250": "Endless cloaks and masks!",
  "266251": "Maggot-ridden!",
  "266252": "An assortment to make the blood curdle!",
  "266899": "A tiger must stay low and close to his prey.",
  "266914": "Still your rage. The trail may not end here.",
  "266915": "There, that must be the villain's ship!",
  "266916": "Keep a good distance, but don't let the wretch slip away.",
  "266917": "Your father's testament is clear! No guilty man would write with such confidence!",
  "266918": "He has nowhere to go.",
  "266919": "There is the ship. Let's keep our distance, see where it goes.",
  "266920": "His words are a warning. Whoever our nemesis is, they are many steps ahead.",
  "266921": "He is dead?",
  "267206": "I can't believe you left me to look after shop.",
  "267211": "This is not what I was born to do.",
  "267212": "Our bond is being seriously tested. What are all these papers?",
  "267213": "Admit it, you've forgotten about me.",
  "267214": "How did Hannah do this all these years? I'm beginning to feel her pain.",
  "267215": "I've got people asking me which palette of what needs to go where!",
  "267458": "If you'd taken me with you, I could have helped!",
  "267464": "I hear you ducked out of a war. Not for the first time, eh, old pal?",
  "267465": "Now is no time for boldness, but caution.",
  "267466": "Don't distract me, old pal. I'm getting better at accounting!",
  "267467": "Edvard! I told you he was rotten as a fig.",
  "267468": "Edvard is behind this? He's pathetic.",
  "267469": "There's a space between revenge and forgiveness.",
  "267539": "Your ill tidings come as no surprise to me. Edvard's face betrays the game is up.",
  "267546": "I pity the man.",
  "267547": "There will be punishment. But Edvard has suffered from the day Samuel died.",
  "267548": "Whatever the punishment, the damage to Edvard is already done.",
  "267549": "We must prepare for a reckoning. Edvard was never the true enemy.",
  "267550": "It is the Pyrphorians behind all of this, we cannot neglect the threat they pose.",
  "267551": "The trial is a distraction. The real danger we are yet to face.",
  "267552": "It is a start. But the Pyrphorians are many.",
  "267553": "Do everything to make sure the Queen is safe, old pal.",
  "267554": "It will be an honour to have the Queen here, but it is not without risk.",
  "267555": "Good, but the Queen may still be vulnerable.",
  "267556": "Stay attuned. This is the perfect time for our enemy to recover.",
  "267557": "We have seen nothing of the Pyrphorians but their minions.",
  "267558": "Whoever is behind the Pyrphorians will take this time to weigh their options.",
  "267559": "We cannot let this business with Edvard divert us from the real threat.",
  "267560": "Black clouds loom, my old friend. Be ready to raise your umbrella.",
  "267561": "I feel uneasy, and it's not the trial.",
  "267562": "Even if we cannot forgive Edvard, we have to learn to let it go.",
  "267563": "I have met the jury. They are idiots!",
  "267564": "The Queen certainly speaks her mind.",
  "267727": "The Pyrphorians have seized Bright Sands. They enchain it to their foul cause!",
  "267747": "The sky above Bright Sands glow with maleficence!",
  "267748": "It is time, old pal. Our nemesis approaches!",
  "267749": "It is time we stamped out this fire for good.",
  "267750": "When they see how bright you burn, old pal, they will shrivel.",
  "267751": "The first of many victories!",
  "267752": "You have my blade. I am ready.",
  "267753": "Old friend, it's over! The last Pyrphorians are sunk!",
  "267754": "Before all this began, I owed you a debt. I may have paid it now, but I've made up my mind to stay, help you grow, at least a little longer.",
  "266382": "Dynamite fishing?! You're serious? Well, the village north is always short on food.",
  "266383": "Remember when we escaped the pits back when? Still some dynamite left...",
  "266384": "I hid it next to the abandoned lighthouse. Go fetch it!",
  "266385": "Here it is! Just get plenty of distance on the throw.",
  "266386": "The dynamite is at the lighthouse, old pal.",
  "266387": "They're not expecting Queen Parrotfish; anything with fins will do.",
  "266388": "All the blistered fish they could ever want.",
  "266389": "A long sea journey won't make me give up my vow to stick by you.",
  "266390": "I owe my life to you. You go, I follow, until I decide the debt is paid.",
  "266391": "You never told me you had a sister, what else haven't you told me about?",
  "266392": "Sometimes you have to face the past to have a future.",
  "266393": "A bird with a spear would be faster.",
  "266394": "You’re just destroying coral, you clown.",
  "266395": "You couldn’t hit a cow’s arse with a sitar.",
  "266396": "Even more roasted fish!",
  "266397": "Still trying to get used to that smell of char.",
  "266398": "You do have an eye for opportunity. After all, it’s not TNT the locals are short of.",
  "266399": "Are we leaving on a packet ship, or has the wind blown through your ears again?",
  "266400": "If it's you lighting the fuse, I'm going to keep well back.",
  "266401": "Must be plenty of fish in this bay.",
  "266402": "Don't look at me—dynamite was your idea.",
  "258102": "Disturb an immortal?!",
  "258103": "I decide when my vigil ends.",
  "258104": "This better be a call to adventure.",
  "258105": "Ready if you are.",
  "258106": "Sat sri akaal, old pal.",
  "258107": "Good to see you, old pal.",
  "258108": "My sword is always ready.",
  "260151": "Purge the filth of ego inside yourself!",
  "260152": "You are that carefree?",
  "260153": "Want to be a hero? Try being a human first.",
  "260154": "Get a grip on your destiny.",
  "260155": "I know you. This isn't you.",
  "260156": "If you seek heaven, you have far to go.",
  "260157": "If you go down, I'll go down with you.",
  "260158": "I'd rather be stuck at sea.",
  "260159": "Monsoons of bad feeling!",
  "260160": "Dreadful.",
  "260161": "God hates us.",
  "260162": "Miserable.",
  "260163": "No-one deserves this.",
  "260164": "Why are we even here?",
  "260165": "For once you have my respect, old pal.",
  "260166": "You've come a long way.",
  "260167": "You bust the world open like ripe fruit.",
  "260168": "Good fire-breather! Thaw this frozen wasteland.",
  "260169": "Conquer your mind, conquer the world.",
  "260170": "You do your family honour.",
  "260171": "Milk the willing cow!",
  "260172": "Sweet nectar.",
  "260173": "Cascades of good feeling.",
  "260174": "We are blessed.",
  "260175": "No sun, but somehow all rosy.",
  "260176": "Better than being at sea.",
  "260177": "God loves us.",
  "260178": "Perfection is close.",
  "260179": "Ah old pal, it's been a while since we adventured together.",
  "260180": "I've been waiting for your call, old pal, wherever you go I will follow.",
  "260241": "Thank the high one.",
  "260242": "This is a blessing.",
  "260243": "Divine succour!",
  "260247": "Hush your mouth!",
  "260248": "Why should I!?",
  "260249": "I will not!",
  "260244": "Of course.",
  "260245": "Odd, but good.",
  "260246": "Curious. I accept.",
  "261120": "The land of many rivers shall see me again, when all is forgiven.",
  "261121": "Old pal, don't you find it strange they keep the recipe for sausage so secret?!",
  "261122": "If the body is the field in which the mind works, would you farm on barren soil?",
  "261123": "Do not incite violence. Prepare for it.",
  "261124": "The music here is fine, but it lacks the colour of a raga.",
  "261125": "I vowed to defend you, it requires no explanation.",
  "261126": "Compared to what brought us together, this is nothing, old pal.",
  "261127": "We met in war; we will find ourselves there again. We must be prepared for that moment.",
  "265436": "I never renounced my faith, I was just taking a pause.",
  "258117": "A pot of gold for the milk of a lioness.",
  "258127": "Our bond runs two ways, does it not?",
  "258128": "Adventure, old pal?",
  "258129": "Here's a chance to let off some steam.",
  "258130": "In the old days we'd have done this in our sleep.",
  "258118": "Fair winds, old pal.",
  "258131": "When we begin, we arrive.",
  "258132": "I owe you one.",
  "258119": "You honour this immortal.",
  "258133": "You make molehills out of mountains!",
  "258134": "Once again, I am indebted to you.",
  "258135": "Just like old times.",
  "258136": "See how the whole world bows before us!",
  "258120": "Might sparring bring your focus back?",
  "258137": "Don't blame yourself, it was not to be.",
  "258138": "Lady luck wasn't on our side.",
  "258121": "If I cannot trust you, who can?",
  "258139": "Changed your mind? They do say change is all we have.",
  "258122": "Do I see a happy face?",
  "258140": "Care to tell me how it went?",
  "258141": "I sense you have news?",
  "258123": "Don't expect success sitting on your heels.",
  "258142": "Back home, it's shameful to have to ask twice.",
  "258143": "When lost, trust your instincts.",
  "258124": "I don't know if you should let down your guard just yet.",
  "258144": "Seems God chose you to do good deeds.",
  "258145": "You know once you stop, I can't be your friend any more.",
  "258125": "It's me, old pal!",
  "258146": "Don't let them lead you astray.",
  "258126": "Leave it with me for a while.",
  "258147": "I'm still making inquiries, old pal.",
  "258148": "I'll be onto something soon, I know it.",
  "262229": "Are you ready to follow the ship?",
  "262230": "We must follow them!",
  "268126": "I've been pondering this problem for a long time, and I feel now is the time to act!",
  "268127": "This cloud has been looming for some time, we must disperse it!",
  "268128": "This might not seem a problem now, but it could one day spiral out of control!",
  "268129": "It is easy to dismiss these things as trivial, but history shows us otherwise...",
  "268130": "You must dispel this illusion, before it becomes real...",
  "268132": "A terror! How did we not foresee it?! We must act swiftly!",
  "268094": "I am the observer, my friend. When there is more than meets the eye, I will let you know.",
  "268097": "The first step is your most important. Make sure to moor at a shore that provides all the soils we need!",
  "268100": "People here are too sniffy to go cross country. Lay a street!",
  "268104": "The people here need somewhere to drown their sorrows. A pub will fill this town with laughter!",
  "268109": "Fear not the new world that awaits beyond. You just have to set sail!",
  "268111": "Bad news! A greedy rival seized the majority of shares on one of your islands. Take back control!",
  "268112": "War! This is serious! End the violence however you can!",
  "268113": "We've been climbers, but our power of influence wanes. We have to recover some leverage.",
  "268114": "Study your texts! Going through your notes once in a while might be quite helpful.",
  "268115": "So you have the lay of the land, good. Now bring those plans to fruition!",
  "268116": "When I look into your people's faces I see trouble. Make sure their misery doesn't become a problem!",
  "268117": "Your people oppose you! Find a way to solve this dangerous predicament soon!",
  "268118": "Fire runs wild! Fight this inferno fast!",
  "253934": "Where have you been? Without you brats we'll never be done with this obligation!",
  "253935": "Nobody likes a traitor, let alone his tainted offspring. Better make yourself scarce.",
  "266717": "What? Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to abducting my workers? The Queen’s ambassador himself shall hear of this.",
  "266727": "Pencil-polishing popinjay! I should have been rid of you long ago!",
  "266728": "The real tragedy here is the vast funeral bill that goes unpaid, while this brat is living the life of O'Reilly!",
  "266943": "No, child. It's too late. Judgement has already come.",
  "266944": "I am.",
  "266945": "No please, don't be afraid. It's time to let go. My ship has sailed...",
  "267035": "What are you talking about, child? Only words between brothers, that's all.",
  "267036": "From the moment I saw you, I knew it meant trouble.",
  "267037": "I knew this would happen. I was just saying to your father, I'll never come up to him—not even having sacrificed it all.",
  "267038": "He never understood the pain, of my life in his shadow.",
  "267039": "I can't be scared. No more than I am already.",
  "267040": "The Pyrphorians are pure evil. I thought I had control of this frightful arrangement, but when they murdered Samuel, I realised a day would come that they came for me too. The day they purge this decaying Empire with fire and flame.",
  "267041": "Lo and behold, Her Majesty! Finally, I become worthy of her notice.",
  "267042": "Yes. Guilty as charged.",
  "261202": "Were you expecting celebrations and a fatted calf on your return?",
  "262228": "I think it was probably your absence in the end that did for your father.",
  "264983": "What, still here? Establishing a rival company? On that dishevelled island?!",
  "264984": "Do you remain here out of spite, or is this some futile attempt at competition?",
  "266535": "You'll not have a dribble of inheritance after all your frivolity out in god-knows-where.",
  "266536": "Prosperity's sale is a disaster for the Empire, the Queen has said as much to me herself!",
  "266537": "Prosperity, sold to New World rebels, can you imagine?!",
  "266538": "Did you expected a fatted calf to be slaughtered on your return?",
  "266539": "You must now see, no-one wants you here.",
  "265007": "As you are so desperate to appear responsible, you’ll be pleased to hear the cost of that fantastical funeral falls to you.",
  "265008": "Your worthless rags have barely covered anything. Now bring me sails— it's not like you have any use for them!",
  "265009": "Repay me now, or sell up!",
  "265010": "Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, four bags full.",
  "265011": "Good kid. Go on now, I'll let you know when I think of the next thing.",
  "265012": "Don’t think you're finished, brat.",
  "265023": "Feels an eternity since the funeral— and the cost! Why it was extortionate!",
  "265024": "I loathe the reek of lanolin, but if farmers smocks are all you have...",
  "265064": "Where are my sails!?",
  "265019": "Haven't seen a prison transport of mine, have you? If you do, be sure to return any salvage to me.",
  "265021": "Don't even think about sheltering Samuel’s co-conspirators! Deliver them to prison at once, and I might lift your debt.",
  "265022": "You have seen sense then. I suppose I shall have to inform Sir Archibald that your obligations are met.",
  "265025": "That was none of your business! And what right has the crown to meddle in my accounts? What right?!",
  "266745": "How long can it take to peel a potato?",
  "266746": "Where is my sausage!?",
  "266747": "Are you darning the things yourself?",
  "266748": "The longer you wait, the less inclined I shall be to write off your sizeable debt.",
  "266749": "A few bottles of bathtub booze?",
  "266750": "Has your cleft of the family no shame, that it now resorts to theft?",
  "266830": "Murdered? You are joking, surely!",
  "267216": "What are you up to overseas?",
  "267229": "When will you give up pursuing the past and look to your future as my charge?",
  "267230": "Gallivanting off again? People will call you irresponsible!",
  "267231": "Sir Archibald sent you, did he?",
  "267232": "You worked so hard to defy me! Then you run away again!",
  "267233": "Have you met with any difficulty out there?",
  "267234": "I promise not to ask any more of you, if you were to spend more time here.",
  "267470": "You don't know what it is you do.",
  "267477": "That island was signed off in Samuel's name!",
  "267478": "Do not speak to me.",
  "267565": "Forget me, my race is run. A true devil is loose. It must be vanquished.",
  "267568": "My defeat can still be your victory.",
  "267569": "I know you want a villain, but this plot goes far beyond my petty greed.",
  "267570": "Then you have all I can give you. I pray that it will be enough.",
  "267571": "I'm sure you wish it was I who died. Well, soon you may have your wish.",
  "267572": "Prosperity was only the beginning. These people will destroy everything and everyone if they have to.",
  "267573": "There is a great danger to the established order. I will give you any help I can.",
  "267574": "My life may be forfeit, but I can still do a last bit of good.",
  "267575": "I didn't know what I was getting into, and then it was too late.",
  "267576": "My father never loved me all these long years, only Samuel.",
  "267577": "I sold our family down the river, no use hiding that now.",
  "267578": "I regret everything. I know what Hannah must think of me.",
  "267579": "I will not play the martyr, but I am ready to sacrifice myself for you and your sister's happiness.",
  "267580": "I have been selfish, but I am not one of them, I never was. You must believe me.",
  "267581": "I did not know they would kill Samuel for it, I had no idea!",
  "253788": "At least make yourself useful.",
  "253820": "Lift a finger for your last significant family!",
  "253821": "Are you just going to stand by?",
  "253822": "Any chance you'll take responsibility?",
  "253823": "I'll bet you're too spoiled to do as you're told.",
  "253789": "I'll believe it when I see it.",
  "253824": "Thinking of the reward?",
  "253825": "Quite unprecedented!",

  "253668": "If you think this is best, who am I to protest.",
  "253669": "I suppose it can be reworded like this!",
  "253670": "Surely these are alternative facts that I'm not privy to.",
  "253671": "This is certainly a perspective to consider.",
  "253672": "Some would call it misleading, but you know what's best!",
  "253673": "If you insist, I … I won't stand in your way.",
  "253674": "It's no problem, our typesetter will be here all night!",

  "260349": "It's peculiar here.",
  "260350": "What do I see here? Little piles of dog lime.",
  "260351": "This might be a once-in-a-lifetime trip.",
  "260352": "As a centre, it is the palest shade of mediocre.",
  "260345": "It lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.",
  "260353": "Pleasant, despite the odd pickpocket.",
  "260354": "I think we've seen everything there is to see.",

  "259969": "Time to rummage in the old sea chest.",
  "259970": "Thank the Admiral.",

  "259972": "Me heart swells like the surf.",
  "259973": "Aye, aye!",
  "259974": "If the Admiral commands it!",
  "259975": "Full steam ahead.",

  "259981": "Nay, I cannae!",
  "259982": "Enough, no more!",
  "259983": "Damned if I will!",
  "253797": "A bold new expedition, Admiral!",
  "253798": "Seductive charts bury my desk!",
  "253799": "These fabled lands exist after all!",
  "253840": "To the edge of the world!",
  "253841": "How we've longed to get back to the blue.",
  "253842": "May we see these shores again.",
  "253843": "Untold perils await us!",
  "253844": "We have the devil to pay.",
  "253845": "Admiral, Admiral!",
  "253846": "All hands at the ready!",
  "253847": "We careen into the unknown!",
  "253848": "We need you, Admiral.",
  "253849": "Please, light our way!",
  "253850": "Shed light in the deeps!",

  "255735": "Too cultured for us scrubbers.",
  "260021": "You do have a ship, Admiral?",
  "260022": "Perhaps some form of sea craft?",

  "260024": "Where is she, let me see her!",
  "260025": "What have yer christened her?",
  "260026": "Something to keep us going, Admiral?",
  "260027": "No provisions?!",
  "260028": "On biscuit alone?",
  "260029": "What of supplies?",
  "260030": "I'd take anything I could just now.",

  "260068": "Only fate truly knows.",
  "260069": "Only the wind can say.",
  "260058": "How many lives have we left?",
  "260070": "Put more skulls on the pile?",

  "260072": "Turn about, before it's too late.",
  "260073": "All I can do is to warn you.",
  "260074": "If doom it must be, we will follow.",
  "260970": "Too soon to head home?",
  "260971": "Have we enough biscuit to last us?",
  "260972": "We better let you decide, admiral.",
  "260973": "What are our chances?",
  "260974": "Do you think we can make it?",
  "253936": "This is it! Ditchwater. End of the world. I hope you like it quiet.",
  "267973": "Sarmento? I know the name. Elusive.",
  "267974": "The New World was discovered long ago, but few have ever found Sarmento.",
  "267970": "There's no deep abyss holds intrigues as eldritch as this.",
  "254622": "We shall want your best ship and crew, this will be a very challenging undertaking.",
  "254623": "Last night I had a disquieting dream— I cannot allow our time to run out.",
  "264606": "We cannot be too thorough in our preparations, yet we must also be swift.",
  "254624": "This is our moment. Let us succeed, where the Arctic Council fails.",
  "254631": "No disappointment can cause me to give up hope my husband lives.",
  "254632": "You are ready to secure a foothold in the north! Find the last— most recent— encampment of my dear John's expedition.",
  "254633": "We have to head north before the Arctic winter takes grip!",
  "264607": "We must make waves, channel my John's spirit of adventure.",
  "254634": "I think you are as determined as I, to find that expedition.",
  "254635": "You may have failed, but the others succeeded. That sort of togetherness is going to be vital.",
  "254639": "I vow to return to the Arctic next spring, braver and stronger for our failure.",
  "264608": "Because we have failed now, does not mean I shall give up hope.",
  "264609": "We didn't even get close, and yet I sense they are there, all of them.",
  "254640": "The Arctic Council show no sign of completing the task they have begun.",
  "264610": "We will not make the same mistakes other rescuers did.",
  "264611": "We have the chance to save what otherwise might be lost to the ice forever.",
  "264612": "This is a matter in which I have a deep personal interest.",
  "264614": "Among the many others, my dearest Sir John, is lost to the ice.",
  "264615": "Signs they were there? The search may begin in earnest!",
  "264616": "The Faithful Expedition shall be the success that no other ever was.",
  "264617": "We must be ready for all eventualities, this shall be no small endeavour.",
  "264618": "The Inuit will know something, I intend to seek their insight at the earliest opportunity.",
  "264619": "We should approach these preparations with clarity of purpose.",
  "264620": "I dream of seeing us cut through the ice like a hot knife through butter!",
  "264621": "I will not rest until the lost expedition are fed, bathed in hot salts and tucked up in their beds.",
  "264622": "I can neglect not one supply that may prove useful in an icy wasteland.",
  "264623": "We cannot underinvest in provisions and equipment.",
  "264624": "We cannot rely on Inuit knowledge alone, we must have our own expertise.",
  "264625": "We need the best minds to have any dream of succeeding.",
  "264626": "The least I can save is my husband's reputation, if indeed he has found a northwest passage.",
  "254644": "The Inuit are witness to this white expanse, they must know something of the expedition.",
  "254645": "Had we listened to the Inuit sooner, the lost might already be found.",
  "264632": "To ignore the wisdom of the Inuit is an arrogance we cannot afford.",
  "264633": "The Arctic Council disregarded Inuit expertise and it got them nowhere!",
  "264639": "I am relieved not all misunderstand the Inuit as you do.",
  "254646": "Ordinary ships cannot breach the ancient ice. Build a dedicated Icebreaker before the channels thicken solid!",
  "254647": "Thank providence we have an Icebreaker! We can but hope it will make us some headway.",
  "264649": "Temperatures will not favour us for long.",
  "264650": "The Faithful Expedition is in dire need of that Icebreaker.",
  "264651": "The Arctic Council thought breaking the ice impossible too, yet someone has clearly managed it!",
  "254648": "The Arctic Council's search party are in trouble, we must help them as we would anyone else.",
  "254649": "We showed them anything is possible with a little belief.",
  "264655": "Let us show the Arctic Council we do not give up on anyone.",
  "264656": "They underestimated the power of nature, but I cannot watch them be punished for it.",
  "264657": "We cannot all hope to best the elements, as the council themselves are always keen to point out.",
  "254651": "We too have been humbled by the forces of nature. I hope that will not be our last chance.",
  "264678": "We still have much to learn from the Inuit, if we are to succeed the next time.",
  "264679": "I thought together we could do it, I hope one day I can still be proven right.",
  "264692": "Coming here, I realise the frightening scale of what lies ahead of us.",
  "264693": "The ice is as old as time, and more stubborn than I'd ever have believed.",
  "264694": "Though it is their own expedition they abandon, the Arctic Council shows no sign of contrition.",
  "264695": "I am more worried than ever for the wellbeing of my husband's crew.",
  "264696": "The Council's hubris coming here, expecting the unconquerable to be conquered!",
  "264697": "How underprepared we are for mother nature! Only a seasonal lull gives us any hope at all.",
  "264698": "My husband is a stubborn man, I only hope he was not too proud to heed the Inuit.",
  "264699": "We have broken through ancient Ice, can I yet be hopeful?",
  "264700": "These narrow channels will thicken solid, if we wait any longer.",
  "264701": "How can they have survived in such a pitiless climate?",
  "264702": "What if their provisions failed? Surely then they'd have been grateful for seals from the Inuit?",
  "264703": "It was the Arctic Council who chose my dearest John, for all his flaws.",
  "264704": "My husband's preparations were meticulous, I only hope he was willing to adapt them.",
  "264705": "What snow-monsters lie in wait, I dare not speculate.",
  "264706": "We must bridge with the Inuit. Perhaps they would trade?",
  "264707": "Our survival hinges on partnership with the Inuit, we must reach out to them somehow.",
  "264709": "The blinding whiteness. I hope I shall be worthy of its grandeur.",
  "264710": "Dinner with the admiralty, is my sum experience of the Arctic, yet now here I am.",
  "264711": "Stone cairns, and signs they camped in this very spot!",
  "264712": "An auspicious place for us to make camp, knowing they too were here.",
  "264713": "We must set up some chain of supply here— who knows how long a search will take.",
  "264714": "Any provisions or equipment we can find will be beneficial to us!",
  "254654": "HMS Hades and Styx came this way, if it takes our last breath we must find them.",
  "254655": "What does it take for a captain to abandon his ship? To go on by foot.",
  "264716": "Are we too late? Is it too late for us too now?",
  "264717": "We are close, I sense them; my John - all of them.",
  "264718": "Follow their aura, as others have done, and we can still find them.",
  "264742": "If it takes our last breath we must find those walkers!",
  "264743": "There is nothing more to be done now, but await the fate of the others.",
  "264744": "That howling! They must long to be found!",
  "264745": "We must strive onward, if it be the end of us.",
  "264746": "This is the end, we must give ourselves to it fully.",
  "264773": "So many sacrifices, but we have brought the survivors home!",
  "264774": "That so many lives have been saved gives me hope anew.",
  "264749": "We must trust the visions of the Inuit, and hope.",
  "264750": "They must have been desperate to forsake the comfort of their cabins.",
  "264751": "That John was not among them matters not, my belief has returned that he roams the ice yet.",
  "264752": "Where are the bodies, if they are all dead?",
  "264753": "Better to find skulls, than nothing at all.",
  "264754": "We should dignify their memory with burial.",
  "264755": "What madness caused them to forsake their equipment?",
  "264756": "New life already clings to the wreckage of the old.",
  "264757": "I can hear them, see their light everywhere!",
  "264758": "The pole star gleams on bone.",
  "264759": "The northland calls us through its open gate.",
  "264760": "It's as if we are on a different plane, where souls reside.",
  "264761": "The Inuit spoke of souls, I think I understand now.",
  "264762": "We must hold fast, the truth will embrace us soon.",
  "267200": "I reach out to all ship's captains, adventurers, luminaries, and merchant traders the length and breadth of the Empire! Heed my call! The life of many a good sailor is on the line.",
  "267201": "It has been three years since the Arctic Council sent its two best ships in search of the legendary north-west passage, led by my dear husband, Sir John Faithful.",
  "267202": "We've not heard from them since. The Arctic Council are sending rescue parties north, but their fleet is too thin to cover that vast territory before the arctic winter kicks in.",
  "267203": "Are you decent and courageous enough to join this sole woman's cause? Worry not! Your combined efforts will be generously recompensed!",
  "267223": "Can it be, the Arctic Council retreating just as we arrive? I mean the chairman is nonetheless correct, the pack ice grows stronger every day. Still, I have no intention of giving up as they have done.",
  "267224": "I have assembled many of the finest-known craftsmen and ship-builders at our outpost. Presently they are preparing the shipyards to house our impressive icebreakers—vessels that will help carve a way through this frozen world.",
  "267225": "I know it is a lot to ask, but will you endure and help me to create the fleet we need?",
  "267235": "I had the strangest dream last evening. I saw my John floating above his quarterdeck. He was waving and shouting but could not make himself heard. The silence prevailed as I approached him, when a giant wolf appeared between us.",
  "267236": "And have we gone too far also, my friend?",
  "267237": "Then let us be swift and brave. If only I knew what awaited us upon this eternal expanse.",
  "267278": "Finally all those sailors may rejoice with their loved ones. I know what you are thinking. But don't worry. I feel no bitterness.",
  "267280": "I know the rest are alive out there, and Sir John's broad shoulders shelter them from wind and snow.",
  "267281": "All the stories being shared about my husband give me the strength to return next summer, with an even bigger fleet. Can I count on you again then? I dare hope so, my friend! I dare hope.",
  "267282": "Let's not beat around the bush! We found nothing but endless white, not a single soul saved.",
  "267283": "And yet I know that my husband and his men are out there somewhere. Frozen cold, but alive! Still alive.",
  "267284": "I will fund another rescue attempt, come back next year, better prepared, with more ships and allies with even greater determination. Will you sail beside me again then? I dare to hope, my friend. I dare to hope!",
  "264419": "Hallelujah.",
  "264420": "The dream is kept alive!",
  "264421": "Praise be for the certainties we have!",
  "264426": "I am eternally grateful for your support.",
  "264427": "You have proven all is still possible.",
  "264428": "You endure where others have not.",
  "264433": "We cannot allow this to stop us believing.",
  "264434": "We have let a chance pass us by.",
  "264435": "Now I feel the wind begin to bite.",
  "264440": "Please, don't follow the Arctic Council's example.",
  "264441": "Perhaps you don't realise the scale of this undertaking.",
  "264442": "You don't seem as committed as the others.",
  "264447": "I, Lady Faithful, knock at every door to rouse the bold and the daring.",
  "264448": "You may know of my husband, Sir John Faithful whose Arctic expedition is lost and forsaken?",
  "264449": "Be assured, your efforts will be suitably rewarded.",
  "264450": "We must stick together if we are to endure the chill.",
  "264451": "It cannot be long now before we find something.",
  "264456": "The absence of a base camp might explain why the Arctic council never sustained their rescue efforts.",
  "264457": "This encampment must embody hope, our one comfort in the wilderness.",
  "264460": "Until the fate of any lost ship is affirmed, our efforts should not diminish.",
  "264461": "Many ships from many sponsors, united by a profound desire to bring back those men alive.",
  "264464": "Just when I was beginning to lose faith.",
  "264465": "If we pull together like this, who knows what we can achieve.",
  "264466": "We must thank the Inuit spirits who dwell here.",
  "264467": "We can do it.",
  "264468": "Yes, I fear we must.",
  "264469": "Yes, we must set our preconceptions aside.",
  "264470": "It would only make me worry.",
  "264471": "Something urges me not to.",
  "264472": "It's impossible.",
  "264496": "I'm very grateful.",
  "264497": "You are doing marvellous work.",
  "264498": "Your generosity won't be forgotten.",
  "264542": "We must rally together now, if we are to find them.",
  "264543": "I value any help I can get, from any direction.",
  "264544": "You will be rewarded, I promise.",
  "264547": "Good, we all are with you.",
  "264548": "Thank you.",
  "264550": "They said it was impossible, you proved them wrong!",
  "264551": "You have survived the elements!",
  "264555": "Was the reward not substantial enough?",
  "264556": "What could have led you astray?",
  "264557": "Seems we've not learned from the mistakes of the past.",
  "264558": "The cold has got to us.",
  "264560": "The Arctic summer is only a brief window.",
  "264561": "We don't have much time.",
  "264563": "It does not end there, we must keep going.",
  "264564": "This must be a sustained effort.",
  "264565": "I know it feels like going from one pole to another.",
  "264600": "You made a seal hole, now catch a seal!",
  "264569": "Have you something?",
  "264570": "Something to give us hope?",
  "264572": "I await news of our next compass heading.",
  "264573": "The matter is out of our hands for the time being.",
  "266259": "Who have we here?! Samuel Goode's child! Want to go down with your father, do you?",
  "266265": "You're too late. I was just a spark, and the touch-paper is already lit...",
  "266980": "They will come for you, for everybody!",
  "266981": "Killing your father was easy…",

  "267187": "We are many.",
  "267188": "The head of the Empire must come off.",
  "267189": "Primal fire burns eternal!",
  "267190": "You have no influence here!",
  "267191": "Interfere with our thralls at your peril!",
  "267192": "You are in dangerous waters!",
  "267193": "These penitents work for us!",
  "267194": "We only kept them alive to do our bidding.",
  "267195": "The thralls will serve our master.",
  "267196": "Isabel and her allies have trangressed for the last time! Die well!",
  "267197": "Now we must inflict what we might have saved for later.",
  "267198": "Isabel has forgotten what we do to those who disobey.",
  "267199": "Fire prolongs the agony of death!",

  "267863": "Martyrs to the cause!",
  "267870": "For each head torn another grows back!",
  "267871": "Master, our organism is withering!",
  "267872": "You said we could not fail, master!",
  "267873": "What of your promises, master? What of our victory?",
  "267874": "When one is torn away, another succeeds",
  "267875": "Light of Prometheus!",
  "267876": "You will be our fuel!",
  "266949": "Yes, Grandmaster! Gladly.",
  "266210": "There was a chance while yer father still lived, no use dragging it out now he's gone…",
  "266211": "Bright Sands will never be matched, if that's what you're set on.",
  "266212": "You are trying at least. I know Samuel wouldn't have given up.",
  "266213": "I'm starting to wonder if you can't turn things around.",
  "266214": "You can't bring back your father, but his spirit…",
  "266218": "I don't know what you're trying to achieve here, but it won't bring Samuel back.",
  "266219": "Mining for you, mining for Eli , what's the difference?",
  "266220": "Your father had that same steely look.",
  "266221": "It's no Bright Sands, but it really is something!",
  "266222": "Your company is flourishing. You may even be the match of your father, rest his soul.",
  "266223": "Samuel Goode’s engineer? Aye, that’s me. Who’s asking?",
  "266226": "So I'm a commodity now, to be bought and sold? Your father treated me like a human being.",
  "266814": "You're stubborn, that's for sure. A chip off the old block.",
  "266815": "So you're the one that fled his duties. Well you're too late, there's nothing to be done.",
  "266816": "You realise this will be no palm-tree paradise, only hard graft?",
  "266817": "My wife tells me I shouldn't be so hard on you.",
  "266818": "You're brave coming back, many people blame all this on you.",
  "266819": "Samuel always had high hopes for you. It was a great blow to him when you left.",
  "266820": "My prison outfit remains in protest.",
  "266821": "Edvard is the major cause of my distemper, not you.",
  "266822": "Somehow got used to these pyjama stripes.",
  "266823": "Dead or alive, I’ll always be Samuel’s man.",
  "266824": "I realise I should have told you sooner.",
  "266825": "Perhaps now you have the means to take justice into your own hands.",
  "266826": "Ah, the prodigal child. Epitome of selfishness.",
  "266827": "It'll take a lot to convince me you're worthy of the name Goode.",
  "266828": "You never know what you have til it's gone, eh?",
  "266829": "Give me a reason to forgive you.",
  "266256": "I had believed it would only do harm to tell you, but I have grounds to believe your father was murdered.",
  "266257": "And the killer, his cellmate, walks free! The rumour is he's in hiding, preparing to flee to the New World.",
  "266258": "It is believed his accomplice supplies him with goods from the Emporium Exotique!",
  "267986": "Theodora! Finally I can hold you in my arms again!",
  "266731": "A shame you can't appreciate the craft this requires. Never mind, the charges have been primed, the perimeter cleared, we are ready to detonate.",
  "266729": "Boom!",
  "265125": "Done.",
  "265127": "Screenshot taken.",

Come on then you bright sparks, gift me an entry in the options menu, this wheelie-bin for half-finished features. Or even better! How about a day-night cycle, huh? Then every five minutes I can cede my throne to a rotten cheese!",

  "266953": "A new world order is at stake— the Empire already shaking to its foundations, and the Goode family helpless to prevent it! We first eradicate the offspring and then eradicate the Queen!",
  "267835": "First Samuel, now Edvard! Soon I will be rid of your dreary family once and for all.",
  "267848": "Goode & Sons. Favourites of the Royal Council. How I've enjoyed watching your family's slow and ignoble demise.",
  "267849": "What a fool Edvard was to trust us!",

  "261577": "When will his children step from the shadow?",
  "266549": "A tragedy! And why are we its chorus!?",
  "261578": "Is it just the wind that howls at night...?",
  "268216": "Ready!",
